The LCA spreadsheet tool is a unique contribution to the feasibility study that provides further insight into the cradle-to-grave environmental impacts associated with the GES over the operating life time, as well as other DDU GES with similar objectives. The tool allows for a more in-depth analysis of the feasibility of DDU GES with respect to the overall environmental impacts. For the U of IL assessment, a doublet (two-well) system is evaluated, which is connected to aboveground mechanical system to supply heating to six agricultural research facilities. The additional of new equipment are assessed for the technical and economic feasibility. The results from this study will also allow geothermal resources from the entirety of the Illinois Basin (ILB) to be assessed and allow the DDU technology to be extended to additional areas of the ILB and other low-temperature sedimentary basins with similar characteristics.","fullName":"Yu-Feng Lin","email":"yflin@illinois.edu","phone":"2173330235","publisher":"University of Illinois","publicationDate":{"sec":1580454000,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Geothermal Heat Recovery Complex: Large-Scale, Deep Direct-Use System in a Low-Temperature Sedimentary Basin","projectNumber":"EE0008106","projectLead":"Arlene Anderson","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Tinjum","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","orcid":"0000-0002-3205-4084"},{"firstName":"Lauren","lastName":"Thomas","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"firstName":"Franklin","lastName":"Holcomb","affiliation":"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ERDC-CERL"}],"resources":[{"name":"DDU LCA Spreadsheet.xlsx","size":103929,"desc":"Excel file containing several worksheets for calculating the cradle-to-grave environmental impacts.","tier":2,"actualName":"DDU LCA Spreadsheet.xlsx","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"data","sampleDate":{"sec":1580454000,"usec":0},"coordinates":[40.0619185,-88.209629],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[40.112153,-88.142388],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[40.011684,-88.27687]}},{"name":"Stanford Paper on U of IL DDU Environmental LCA","desc":"Link to Stanford Geothermal Workshop Paper describing data included in this GDR submission.","tier":1,"resourceType":"link","isLocal":false,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1581490800,"usec":0},"coordinates":[40.0619185,-88.209629],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[40.112153,-88.142388],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[40.011684,-88.27687]},"URI":"https:\/\/pangea.stanford.edu\/ERE\/db\/GeoConf\/papers\/SGW\/2020\/Thomas.pdf"}],"keywords":["geothermal","energy","deep direct-use","ddu","Illinois Basin","sedimentary basin","low-temperature","agrcicultural research facilities","life cycle assessment","lca","spreadsheet tool","cradle-to-grave environmental impacts","feasibility","life cycle","assessment","environment","environmental","impact","benefit","tool","University of Illinois","Champagne Urbana"],"created":"02\/19\/2020","updated":[{"sec":1582144177,"usec":0},{"sec":1582144406,"usec":0},{"sec":1582144477,"usec":0},{"sec":1582144579,"usec":0},{"sec":1582144693,"usec":0},{"sec":1582662182,"usec":0},{"sec":1582662193,"usec":0},{"sec":1582662303,"usec":0}],"submitted":{"sec":1582144177,"usec":0},"status":"Publicly accessible","userId":26405,"xdrId":1204,"DOI":"10.15121\/1601452","hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":true,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"5e41a54aa01d47d22ba56cf8"},"submissionName":"Dynamic Earth Energy Storage: Terawatt-Year, Grid-Scale Energy Storage using Planet Earth as a Thermal Battery (GeoTES): Seedling Project Final Report","abstract":"Grid-scale energy storage has been identified as a needed technology to support the continued build-out of intermittent renewable energy resources. As of April 2017, the U.S. had approximately 24.2 GW of energy storage on line, compared to 1,081 GW of installed generation capacity (Litynski et al. 2006, Hellstr\u00f6m 2003). This represents a large shortfall of the storage needed to stabilize the U.S. grids with the rising penetration of renewable energy. Our team proposed to address this shortfall through the storage of excess energy as geothermal brine in deep geologic formations. This concept, known as geologic thermal energy storage (GeoTES), relies on the storage of thermal energy in geologic formations for recovery and use in large-scale direct use geothermal applications. As such, GeoTES has the potential to play a significant role in meeting the energy storage shortfall in the coming decades by assisting with peak demand ramping, easing stress on transmission, providing regional storage to support sustainable direct use geothermal applications, and providing a variety of grid stabilization benefits due to renewable outages or inaccurate forecasting and rotor stability.","fullName":"Ghanashyam Neupane","email":"ghanashyam.neupane@inl.gov","publisher":"Idaho National Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1559282400,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Geothermal Energy Storage","projectNumber":"EE0034959","projectLead":"Arlene Anderson","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Travis","lastName":"McLing","affiliation":"Idaho National Laboratory","orcid":"0000-0002-4394-2693"},{"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Wendt","affiliation":"Idaho National Laboratory","orcid":"0000-0003-4491-4296"},{"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Dobson","affiliation":"LBNL"},{"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Doughty","affiliation":"LBNL"},{"firstName":"Nic","lastName":"Spycher","affiliation":"LBNL"},{"firstName":"Dakota","lastName":"Roberson","affiliation":"University of Idaho"},{"firstName":"J.

In late 2014, the project was further expanded to include analysis of methane hydrates and slope stability off the US east coast. This research is part of a now 4.5 year study funded by the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) that analyzes methane hydrate stability on both the Atlantic and Beaufort Margin.  Key goals of this study include integrating and processing marine seismic data collected at the USGS as well as other publicly available data with dynamic 2D\/3D\/4D heat flow models developed at SMU to determining the depth, location, and dynamics of methane hydrate stability along the Alaskan Beaufort Margin and similar environments. A major component of this study is to constrain how the methane hydrate stability zone is changing with time.  Additional goals of this study include determining areas where concentrated methane hydrate might exist in the subsurface and to understand the role methane hydrate plays in slope stability along continental margins. To accomplish these goals, researchers use geophysical (seismic, heat flow, CTD\/XBT) data combined with numerical models to assess methane hydrate stability in space and time. Researchers also integrate regional coring and biological data with methane hydrate stability models to place further constraints on hydrate dynamics. The USGS component of this research focus on addressing methane hydrate stability along the US Atlantic Margin; the SMU component focus on the US Beaufort Sea. \n\nThis submission includes a draft cruise report with initial data and outlining heat flow data collection methods\n","fullName":"Matt Hornbach","email":"matt.hornbach@gmail.com","phone":"5126365030","publisher":"Southern Methodist

facilities at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Morgantown, West Virginia site were used to characterize core of the Tuscarora Sandstone from a vertical well in Preston County WV, the Preston-119 from a depth of 7,165 to 7,438 ft. The primary impetus of this work is a collaboration between West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey (WVGES) and NETL to characterize core from multiple wells to better understand the geologic framework of key stratigraphic units in West Virginia. As part of this effort, bulk scans of core were obtained from the Pres-119 well, provided by the WVGES. This report, and the associated scans generated, provide detailed datasets not typically available for researchers to analyze.\n\nThis dataset contains CT scan images collected from the cores obtained from Clay 513, Harrison 79, and Preston 119 wells. Additional processing of the CT scan data from Preston 119 well is performed to semi-quantitatively assess fracture volume.

This study applies numerical simulations to investigate reservoir impedance and thermal production. Because of the great depth of the geothermal reservoir, few data are available to characterize reservoir features and properties.  As a result, the study focuses on the following three aspects: 1. model choice for predicting reservoir impedance and thermal breakthrough: after investigating three potential models (one single permeability model and two dual permeability models) for flow through fractured rock, it is decided to use single permeability model for further analysis; 2. well placement (horizontal vs. vertical) options: horizontal well placement seems to be more robust to heterogeneity and the impedance is more acceptable; 3. Prediction uncertainty: the most influential parameters are identified using  a First-Order-Second-Moment uncertainty propagation analysis, and the uncertain range of the model predictions is estimated by performing a Monte Carlo simulation. Heterogeneity has a large impact on the perdition, therefore, is considered in the predictive model and uncertainty analysis. The numerical model results and uncertainty analysis are used for economic analysis. The dataset submitted here support the described study.

The first multi-well experimental site was established at the 4850 level in the Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota, where hydraulic fractures were created at an injection well drilled sub-horizontal from the drift. This file contains the second set of tracer data (also include the data uploaded previously, https:\/\/gdr.openei.org\/submissions\/1128) for the EGS Collab testbed. The tracer tests were conducted during October 2018 - November 2019. Injected tracers include DNA, C-dots (fluorescein nano particles), fluorescein, rhodamine-b, sodium chloride, lithium bromide and cesium iodine.  The tracers have been detected in three flowing wells located about 7.5 to 9 meters away from the injection interval. The tracer breakthrough curves from these locations have been adjusted to account for the residence time in the injection and production tubing.

The study included assessment of the natural rock properties within and surrounding two potential reservoirs, coupled to the assessment of the thermal energy needs for a district heating system capable of supplying 20% of Cornell's building heating load. The feasibility and benefits of such a district heating system at the specific location of Cornell University's Ithaca, NY campus are evaluated from the perspectives of economic cost, environmental benefits, and economic benefits in the region external to Cornell University. The economic cost is expressed as the Levelized Cost of Heat, and comparison to the existing inexpensive fossil fuel system.\n\nThe submission includes descriptions of the assumptions, analyses, data, and models that were combined to reach conclusions regarding the feasibility of a Cornell Campus project.\n\nA shortened, descriptive title for the project is \"Direct District Heating for the Cornell Campus Utilizing Deep Geothermal Energy.\"\n","fullName":"Teresa E.

Because geothermal feasibility is not determined by any single factor (e.g., temperature, permeability, permitting), a site?s project grade and readiness are evaluated on 12 attributes pertaining to geological, technical, or socio-economic feasibility.

The consistent and objective assessment protocols used in GeoRePORT allow for comparison of project attributes across unique locations and geological settings.

The case studies illustrate the usefulness of GeoRePORT in evaluating project risk and return, identifying gaps in reported data, evaluating R&D impact, and gathering insights on successes and failures as applicable to future projects.

The tests were made at the Cymric oil field, which is a steam flood operation. The wells therefore undergo similar downhole conditions as geothermal wells. The Cymric field is mainly a cyclic steam operation where wells are 1000-15-00 ft in depth and the reservoir occupies the bottom 400ft. The maximum temperatures can exceed 500 degrees F and the well spacing is very close, often less than 50m. The field plan consisted of applying the Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) method to the wells. The input voltages were set as 70 V shows the TDR responses at frequencies of 450 kHz, 2500 kHz, and 4500 kHz. There is a summary report will full information about the field tests.

We note that for the data fit the code also incorporated well casings for well INJ and the other observation well, either OB1 or OB2, in the calculation.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrate here, for this particular case, that the DC results may be a reasonable approximation to the low frequency EM data collected at CaMI.  If this approximation continues to hold, then the extreme computational efficiency offered by the hierarchical modeling used in the DC simulations will permit us to explore far more model complexity, especially the pervasive and troublesome data artifacts that arise when doing EM surveys in mature, culturally developed sites.\n\nIn Brief, both the low frequency and DC simulation codes provided very consistent results that match the field data really well, indicating their capability to help monitoring borehole integrity with the low frequency EM method.","fullName":"Jiannan Wang","email":"JiannanWang@lbl.gov","phone":"5104866673","publisher":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1556604000,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Wellbore Integrity asSEssment with Casing-based Advanced SenSING (WISE-CASING)","projectNumber":"EE0033208","projectLead":"Mike Weathers","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Jiannan","lastName":"Wang","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","orcid":"0000-0003-3312-6833"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wilt","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}],"resources":[{"name":"CaMI Top Casing Source Configuration.PNG","size":98357,"desc":"Oblique view diagram showing locations of OBS1, OBS2, INJ, the receiver profile, and the return electrode.","tier":1,"actualName":"cami_top_casing_source_configuration.PNG","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_diagram","sampleDate":{"sec":1556604000,"usec":0},"coordinates":[50.653933452267,-113.38843417969],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[51.271714233863,-112.46563320312],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[50.036152670671,-114.31123515625]}},{"name":"CaMI Summary Report.docx","size":302277,"desc":"Document summarizing the model calculation, the comparison of field data to forward-modeled data, and preliminary conclusions.

The Coast Range to the west has undergone Paleogene transtension and Neogene transpression, which is reflected in basin stratigraphy. To better understand the tectonic evolution of the region, Darby Scanlon modeled three key stratigraphic horizons and their associated depocenters (areas of maximum sediment accumulation) through space and time using well log, seismic, outcrop, aeromagnetic, and gravity data. Three isochore maps were created to constrain the location of Portland and Tualatin basin depocenters during 1) Pleistocene to mid-Miocene (0-15 Ma), 2) eruption of the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG, 15.5-16.5 Ma), and 3) MidMiocene to late Eocene time (~17-35 Ma). \n\nResults show that the two basins each have distinct mid-Miocene to Pleistocene depocenters. The depth to CRBG in the Portland basin reaches a maximum of ~1,640 ft, 160 ft deeper than the Tualatin basin. Although the Portland basin is separated from the Tualatin basin by the Portland Hills, inversion of gravity data suggests that the two were connected as one continuous basin prior to CRBG deposition. Local thickening of CRBG flows over a gravity low coincident with the Portland Hills suggests that Neogene transpression in the forearc reactivated the SylvanOatfield and Portland Hills faults as high angle reverse faults. This structural inversion separated the once continuous Portland and Tualatin basins in the mid-late Miocene. A change in the stress regime at that time marks the transition from Paleogene forearc extension to deformation dominated by north-south shortening due to collision of the forearc against the Canadian Coast Mountains. An eastward shift of the forearc basin  ii depocenter over the Neogene likely reflects uplift of the Coast Range to the west. A change in regional stress in the mid to late-Miocene, along with uplift of the Oregon Coast Range, caused a 10-fold decrease in sediment accumulation rates across the Portland and Tualatin basins. Transpressional oblique-slip faulting continues to deform the region as the forearc undergoes clockwise rotation and collides with the rigid Canadian Coast Mountains to the north.","fullName":"Darby

improve our understanding of hydraulic stimulations in crystalline rock for enhanced geothermal energy production through execution of intensely monitored meso-scale experiments. The first experiment is being performed at the 4850 ft level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), approximately 1.5 km below the surface at Lead, South Dakota.\n\nHere we report on microseismic monitoring of repeated stimulation experiments and subsequent flow tests between two boreholes in the Poorman Formation. Stimulations were performed at several locations in the designated injection borehole at flow rates from 0.1 to 5 L\/min over temporal durations from minutes to hours. Microseismic monitoring was performed using a dense 3D sensor array including two cemented hydrophone strings with 12 sensors at 1.75 m spacing accompanied by 18 3-C accelerometers, deployed in 6 monitoring boreholes, completely surrounding the stimulation region. Continuous records were obtained over a two-month period using a novel dual recording system consisting of a conventional 96 channel exploration seismograph and a high-performance 64 channel digitizer sampling sensors at 4 and 100 kHz respectively. \n\nUsing a standard STA\/LTA triggering algorithm, we detected thousands of microseismic events with recorded energy in a frequency range generally above 3 kHz and up to 40 kHz. The locations of these events are consistent with creation of a hydraulic fracture and additional reactivation of pre-existing structures. Using manual pick refinement and double-difference relocation we are able to track the fracture growth to high precision. We estimate the times and locations of the fracture intersecting a monitoring and the production borehole using microseismic events. They are in excellent agreement with independent measurements using distributed temperature sensing, in-situ strain observations and measurements of conductivity changes.","publisher":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","hasConsent":"1","submitted":{"sec":1564423763,"usec":0},"DOI":"10.15121\/1557417","hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":true,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"5d374427a01d478c7836fa84"},"submissionName":"WISE-CASING: Time Domain Reflectometry Data from Lab Experiment on Steel Pipe","abstract":"The steel pipe experiment conducted in the lab was using 6 meter low-carbon steel pipe.

Specifically, modelling of gravity data in 3D, used in conjunction with rock density measurements and other subsurface geologic information can provide an independent test of an existing 3D geologic model (e.g. Witter et al., 2018).

One objective of the project is to establish circulation from injector to producer by hydraulically fracturing the injector.\n\nData generated during these experiments is to be compared with predictions from coupled thermal, hydrological, mechanical, and chemical simulators. One such a simulator, TOUGH2-CSM, has been enhanced in order to simulate EGS Collab SIGMA-V project experiments. These modifications include adding tracers, the capability to model tracer sorption, and an embedded fracture formulation.\n\nA set of example problems validate our conservative tracer transport and sorption formulations.

A new approach to measuring earth tides using fiber optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is presented here. DAS was originally designed to record acoustic vibration through the measurement of dynamic strain on a fiber optic cable. Here, laboratory experiments demonstrate that oscillating strain can be measured with DAS in the microHertz frequency range, corresponding to half-day (M2) lunar tidal cycles. Although the magnitude of strain measured in the laboratory is larger than what would be expected due to earth tides, a clear signal at half-day period was extracted from the data. With the increased signal-to-noise expected from quiet field applications and improvements to DAS using engineered fiber, earth tides could potentially be measured in deep boreholes with DAS. Because of the distributed nature of the sensor (0.25 m measurement interval over kilometers), fractures could be simultaneously located and evaluated. Such measurements would provide valuable information regarding the placement and stiffness of open fractures in bedrock. Characterization of bedrock fractures is an important goal for multiple subsurface operations such as petroleum extraction, geothermal energy recovery, and geologic carbon sequestration.\n","fullName":"Matthew W Becker","email":"matt.becker@csulb.edu","phone":"5629858983","publisher":"California State University","publicationDate":{"sec":1516777200,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Phase I Project: Fiber Optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Periodic Hydraulic Tests","projectNumber":"EE0006763","projectLead":"William Vandermeer","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Coleman","affiliation":"Silixa LLC"},{"firstName":"Matthew W.","lastName":"Becker","affiliation":"Department of Geological Sciences California State University Long Beach"}],"resources":[{"name":"Oscillating Strain Data using DAS.mat","size":1173747793,"desc":"These data are associated with the article published in the Journal \"Sensors\" : \"Distributed Acoustic Sensing of Strain at Earth Tide Frequencies\" by Matthew W Becker and Thomas I Coleman, Vol. 19, 2019.\n\nData are in matlab format and are the mean strain rate in nm\/s over channels 360-519 as described in the article.

The material is unconsolidated and\/or fractured, especially in the shallow layers. The structural trends follow the fault system in strike and dip. The geodetic measurements favor the hypothesis of thermal contraction. Temporal changes in pressure, subsidence rate, and seismic amplitude are associated with changes in pumping rates during the four stages of the deployment in 2016. The modeled hydraulic conductivity is high in fault damage zones.

A Silixa iDAS interrogator acquired data on single-mode fibers for approximately two hours prior to detonation on December 19, 2018 at 18:45:57 (UTC).  Measurements continued for approximately fifteen minutes after detonation.  iDAS channel spacing is 1.021 m and gauge length is 10 m.  Concurrent Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) measurements made with a Silixa XT on the mulit-mode fibers aided in calibrating the DAS measurements.

Model of Mt. Simon Sandstone for University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign DDU feasibility study","abstract":"The geocellular model of the Mt. Simon Sandstone was constructed for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign DDU feasibility study. Starting with the initial area of review (18.0 km by 18.1 km [11.2 miles by 11.3 miles]) the boundaries of the model were trimmed down to 9.7 km by 9.7 km (6 miles by 6 miles) to ensure that the model enclosed a large enough volume so that the cones of depression of both the production and injection wells would not interact with each other, while at the same time minimizing the number of cells to model to reduce computational time. The grid-cell size was set to 61.0 m by 61.0 m (200 feet by 200 feet) for 160 nodes in the X and Y directions. Within the model, 67 layers are represented that are parameterized with their sediment\/rock properties and petrophysical data.\n\nThe top surface of the Mt. Simon Sandstone was provided by geologists working on the project, and the average thickness of the formation was taken from the geologic prospectus they provided. An average thickness of 762 m (2500 feet) was used for the Mt. Simon Sandstone, resulting in 60 layers for the model. Petrophysical data was taken from available rotary sidewall core data (Morrow et al., 2017). As geothermal properties (thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity) are closely related to mineralogy, specifically the percentage of quartz, available mineralogical data was assembled and used with published data of geothermal values to determine these properties (Waples and Waples, 2004; Robertson, 1988). The Mt. Simon Sandstone was divided into three separate units (lower, middle, upper) according to similar geothermal and petrophysical properties, and distributed according to available geophysical log data and prevailing interpretations of the depositional\/diagenetic history (Freiburg et al. 2016). Petrophysical and geothermal properties were distributed through geostatistical means according to the associated distributions for each lithofacies. The formation temperature was calculated, based on data from continuous temperature geophysical log from a deep well drilled into the Precambrian basement at the nearby Illinois Basin Decatur Project (IBDP) where CO2 is currently being sequestered (Schlumberger, 2012). Salinity values used in the model were taken from regional studies of brine chemistry in the Mt. Simon Sandstone, including for the IBDP (e.g., Panno et al. 2018). After being reviewed by the project's geologists, the model was then passed onto the geological engineers to begin simulations of the geothermal reservoir and wellbores.\n","fullName":"Andrew Stumpf","email":"astumpf@illinois.edu","phone":"2172446462","publisher":"University of Illinois","publicationDate":{"sec":1546239600,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Geothermal Heat Recovery Complex: Large-Scale, Deep Direct-Use System in a Low-Temperature Sedimentary Basin","projectNumber":"EE0008106","projectLead":"Arlene Anderson","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Damico","affiliation":"University of Illinois"}],"resources":[{"name":"Rescue Format.zip","size":40514780,"desc":"Geocellular model of Mt.

Measurements were made with a Silixa XT DTS interrogator configured to continuously record in each file a sixty-second average of stokes and anti-stokes readings on a single channel with a bottom hole U-bend.  The 2016 data were collected using a Silixia Ultima with 12.5 cm spatial sampling, whereas the XT spatial sampling interval is 25 cm with a temperature resolution of 0.03 \u00b0C.  Raw, uncalibrated data were converted to a single .MAT file using code provided by Oregon State University's CTEMPs https:\/\/ctemps.org\/data-processing.

Under the Portland Basin, the lower Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) aquifers contain brackish water (1,000-10,000 mg\/L TDS), indicating low groundwater flow rates and poor connection with the overlying regional aquifer. Further, CRBG lavas tend to have comparatively low thermal conductivity, indicating that the 400-1,000 ft thick CRBG may be an effective thermal barrier to the overlying aquifer. A temporally and spatially limited previous study of a Portland Basin CRBG aquifer demonstrated that the injection of waste heat resulted in an increase in temperature by more than a factor of two, indicating a high potential for storing heat. \n\nThis data submission includes ASCII grid surfaces for the Portland and Tualatin Basins including a DEM of modern topography, the top of Columbia River Basalt (CRB), the base of CRB, and basement.

Three strains of E. coli were studied: (1) the native E. coli surface, (2) a mutant E. coli surface with hindered, non-binding lanthanide binding tags, and (3) an LBT E. coli surface with fully functioning lanthanide binding tags. A three discrete site, constant capacitance surface complexation modeling approach was taken in studying these strains with an ultimate goal of comparing site type affinities to the model rare earth, Terbium. Our results show a possible increase in native carboxyl functional groups when the LBTs are overexpressed on the cell surface. LBTs are confirmed to have a higher stability constant with Terbium than that of the native functional groups. Incorporation of LBTs into the E. coli cell wall poses two major benefits: (1) the presence of a high-affinity, low-capacity LBT site for selective Terbium binding at low metal loading regions, and (2) a lower-affinity carboxyl site that increases the sorption capacity of the native bacterial surface during sorption at higher metal loading regions.\n","fullName":"Yongqin Jiao","email":"jiao1@llnl.gov","phone":"9254224482","publisher":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1522562400,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Extraction of Rare Earth Metals from Geothermal Fluids using Bioengineered Microbes","projectNumber":"LLNL FY17 AOP 25112","projectLead":"Josh Mengers","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Yongqin","lastName":"Jiao","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","orcid":"0000-0002-6798-5823"}],"resources":[{"name":"Ecoli - Tb Manuscript.docx","size":145949,"desc":"A summary of progress so far on Surface Complexation Modeling of rare earth adsorption.

Constraints on Geothermal Sustainability Through Reservoir Characterization at Brady Geothermal Field, Nevada","abstract":"The vast supply of geothermal energy stored throughout the Earth and the exceedingly long time required to dissipate that energy makes the world's geothermal energy supply nearly limitless. As such, this resource holds the potential to provide a large supply of the world's energy demands; however, like all natural resources, it must be utilized in an appropriate manner if it is to be sustainable. Understanding sustainable use of geothermal resources requires thorough characterization efforts aimed at better understanding subsurface properties. The goal of this work is to understand which critical subsurface properties exert the most influence on sustainable geothermal production as a means to provide targeted future resource characterization strategies.\n\nBorehole temperature and reservoir pressure data were analyzed to estimate reservoir thermal and hydraulic properties at an active geothermal site. These reservoir properties then served as inputs for an analytical model which simulated net power production over a 30-year period. The analytical model was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters were most critical in constraining the sustainability of a geothermal reservoir. Modeling results reveal that the number of preferential flow pathways (i.e. fractures) used for heat transport provides the greatest impact on geothermal reservoir sustainability. These results suggest that early and pre-production geothermal reservoir exploration would achieve the greatest benefit from characterization strategies which seek to delineate the number of active flow pathways present in the system.","fullName":"Jeremy Patterson","email":"jpatterson7@wisc.edu","publisher":"University of Wisconsin","publicationDate":{"sec":1531288800,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"PoroTomo Project","projectNumber":"EE0006760","projectLead":"Elisabet Metcalfe","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Jeremy R.","lastName":"Patterson","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin","orcid":"0000-0003-3343-633X"}],"resources":[{"name":"PattersonMSThesis2018.pdf","size":4674586,"desc":"M.S.

Plotting acquisition dates (epochs) as vertices and pair-wise interferometric combinations as edges defines an incidence graph. The edge-vertex incidence matrix and the normalized edge Laplacian matrix are factors in the covariance matrix for the pair-wise data. Using empirical measures of residual scatter in the pair-wise observations, we estimate the variance at each epoch by inverting the covariance of the pair-wise data. We evaluate the rank deficiency of the corresponding least-squares problem via the edge-vertex incidence matrix. We implement our method in a MATLAB software package called GraphTreeTA available on GitHub (https:\/\/github.com\/feigl\/gipht). We apply temporal adjustment to the data set described in Lu et al. (2005) at Okmok volcano, Alaska, which erupted most recently in 1997 and 2008. The data set contains 44 differential volumetric changes and uncertainties estimated from interferograms between 1997 and 2004. Estimates show that approximately half of the magma volume lost during the 1997 eruption was recovered by the summer of 2003. Between June 2002 and September 2003, the estimated rate of volumetric increase is (6.2 +\/- 0.6) x 10^6 m^3\/yr. Our preferred model provides a reasonable fit that is compatible with viscoelastic relaxation in the five years following the 1997 eruption. Although we demonstrate the approach using volumetric rates of change, our formulation in terms of incidence graphs applies to any quantity derived from pair-wise differences, such as wrapped phase or wrapped residuals.\n\nDate of final oral examination: 05\/19\/2016\nThis thesis is approved by the following members of the Final Oral Committee: Kurt L.

The area of interest is the Eastman Chemical plant in Longview, Texas, which is on the northwestern margin of the Sabine Uplift.  The study is focused on determining the potential for a geothermal reservoir within a 10 km radius of the site as defined by data from existing geological studies and cross-sections within the depths of 2,100 to 3,400 meters.  Wells within a 20 km radius are included for broader geological comparison to determine the heat flow, temperature-at-depth, and oil and gas field porosity and permeability.  The geothermal reservoir model is based on the multiple formation top data sources, published literature data, and well log interpretations within the 10 km radius.   Area thickness estimates, reservoir extent bounding parameters, potential flow rates, and temperatures are combined to calculate a reservoir productivity index and develop a reservoir production model.  Historical fluid volumes production data are used as an independent check for the reservoir productivity index and production model results.  The reservoir parameters calculated here are being used for the surface engineering model to determine the economic viability of using geothermal fluids for a deep direct use application at this site.

The array was composed of 238 5 Hz, three-component nodal instruments and 8,700 m of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fiber-optic cable installed in surface trenches plus 400 m installed in a borehole. The geophone array had about 60 m instrument spacing in the target zone, whereas DAS channel separations were about 1 m. The acquisition systems provided 15 days of continuous records including active source and ambient noise signals. A large vibroseis truck (T-Rex) was operated at 196 locations exciting a swept-frequency signal from 5 to 80 Hz over 20 seconds using three vibration modes. Sweeps were repeated up to four times during different modes of geothermal plant operation: normal operation, shutdown, high and oscillatory injection and production, and normal operation again. The cross- correlation method was utilized to remove the sweep signal from the geophone records. The first P arrivals were automatically picked from the cross-correlation functions using a combination of methods, and the travel times were used to invert for the 3D P-wave velocity structure.\n\nModels with 50 m horizontal node spacing were obtained, with vertical node spacing of 10 to 50 m. The travel time data were fit to about 30 ms, close to our estimated picking uncertainty. Boundaries between high and low velocity zones agree with previous surveys of local faults and low velocity zones near the surface correspond to fumarole locations. A rapid increase in velocity at about 50 m depth fits with borehole data on the depth of the Quaternary sediments. There is some evidence for changes in the P-wave velocity during the experiment with slower travel times at the beginning of the experiment.","fullName":"Kurt Feigl","email":"feigl@wisc.edu","publisher":"University of Wisconsin","publicationDate":{"sec":1502258400,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"PoroTomo Project","projectNumber":"EE0006760","projectLead":"Elisabet Metcalfe","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Lesley M.","lastName":"Parker","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin"}],"resources":[{"name":"3D Seismic Tomography of Brady Hot Springs.pdf","size":28091033,"desc":"Master's Thesis of Lesley Parker focused on active source 3D seismic tomography of Brady Hot Springs Geothermal Field, NV.","tier":1,"actualName":"Parker_MS_Thesis.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1502258400,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Brady Hot Springs Geothermal Area","coordinates":[39.7883,-119.0167],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[39.9883,-118.8167],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[39.5883,-119.2167]}}],"keywords":["geothermal","Brady Hot Springs","Nevada","seismic tomography","active source","PoroTomo","brady geothermal field","bradys","shallow","seismic imaging","poroelastic tomography"],"created":"06\/07\/2018","updated":[{"sec":1528398082,"usec":0},{"sec":1528826342,"usec":0},{"sec":1528826590,"usec":0},{"sec":1528826762,"usec":0},{"sec":1528826771,"usec":0}],"submitted":{"sec":1528398082,"usec":0},"status":"Publicly accessible","userId":24578,"xdrId":1070,"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"5b0daf3da01d470a307ba25c"},"submissionName":"Fallon FORGE: Well 21-31 Wireline Logs","abstract":"Included are the following wireline logs from the Fallon FORGE Well 21-31:\n\nOrmat_Forge 21-31_8.5 inch section:\nFMI data in PDF and DLIS formats;\nMSCT data in PDF format;\nPressure and Temperature data in PDF, LAS, and DLIS formats;\nSonic Scanner data in PDF, DLIS, and LAS formats (LAS format contains Stoneley Slowness, Shear Slowness, and Compressional Slowness logs);\nTriple Combo in PDF, DLIS, and LAS formats; and\nUSIT data in DLIS and PDF formats.\n\nOrmat_Forge_21-31_12.25 inch section:\nResistivity data in PDF and LAS formats;\nSonic Scanner data in PDF, DLIS, and LAS formats (LAS format contains Stoneley Slowness, Shear Slowness, and Compressional Slowness logs);\nTriple Combo in PDF and LAS formats; and\nCaliper data in PDF format (DLIS format for caliper data is included in the Sonic Scanner DLIS).","fullName":"Doug Blankenship","email":"dablank@sandia.gov","publisher":"Sandia National Laboratories","publicationDate":{"sec":1521007200,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy: Fallon, NV","projectNumber":"EE0007160","projectLead":"Lauren Boyd","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Blankenship","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"}],"resources":[{"name":"21-31 Wireline Logs.zip","size":4768880151,"desc":"The Ormat Forge 21-31 8.5 inch section and Ormat Forge 21-31 12.25 inch section.

Measured temperatures\/gradients from deeper wells (when available and reasonably close to a given well) were used to help constrain the extrapolation to greater depths.  \n\nMost of the field names in the attribute table are intuitive, however HF = heat flow, intercept = the temperature at the surface (x-axis of the temperature-depth plots) based on the linear segment of the plot that was used to extrapolate the temperature profiles to greater depths, and depth_m is the total well depth.

Herein, we examined the techno-economic performance of integrating a biosorption approach into a large-scale process for producing salable total rare earth oxides (TREOs) from various feedstocks. An airlift bioreactor is proposed to carry out a biosorption process mediated by bioengineered rare earth-adsorbing bacteria. Techno-economic assessments were compared for three distinctive categories of REE feedstocks requiring different pre-processing steps. Key parameters identified that affect profitability include REE concentration, composition of the feedstock, and costs of feedstock pretreatment and waste management. Among the 11 specific feedstocks investigated, coal ash from the Appalachian Basin was projected to be the most profitable, largely due to its high-value REE content. Its cost breakdown includes pre-processing (leaching primarily, 77.1%), biosorption (19.4%), and oxalic acid precipitation and TREO roasting (3.5%). Surprisingly, biosorption from the high-grade Bull Hill REE ore is less profitable due to high material cost and low production revenue. Overall, our results confirmed that the application of biosorption to low-grade feedstocks for REE recovery is economically viable.","fullName":"Yongqin Jiao","email":"jiao1@llnl.gov","phone":"9254224482","publisher":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1507528800,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Extraction of Rare Earth Metals from Geothermal Fluids using Bioengineered Microbes","projectNumber":"LLNL FY17 AOP 2.5.1.12","projectLead":"Holly Thomas","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Yongqin","lastName":"Jiao","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Hongyue","lastName":"Jin","affiliation":"Purdue University"},{"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Park","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Gupta","affiliation":"Purdue University"},{"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Brewer","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Lewis","lastName":"Ho","affiliation":"Bioreactor Sciences"},{"firstName":"Suzanne","lastName":"Singer","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"William","lastName":"Bourcier","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Woods","affiliation":"Navajo Transitional Energy Company"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Reed","affiliation":"Idaho National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Lammers","affiliation":"University of California Berkeley"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Sutherland","affiliation":"Purdue University"}],"resources":[{"name":"Manuscript.pdf","size":1263314,"desc":"A manuscript published in ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering including sections on feedstock description, REE biosorption, TEA for biosorption, sensitivity analyses of biomass recycling and REE pricing, and future improvement opportunities.

Data are provided for 3 major geothermal models: heat, permeability, and fluid-filled fractures, and an additional infrastructure model. Both of the permeability and fluid-filled-fracture models are produced at 200 m and at 2 km depths; the heat model is only produced at the 200 m depth. Values are provided for both model favorability and model confidence. A combined model at 200m and 2 km depths is provided for favorability, confidence, and exploration risk.\n\nRaster data are provided in GeoTiff format and have a statewide coverage. Cell size is 104.355 ft; file type is unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255); 0 represents no favorability or confidence; 255 represents maximum favorability or confidence. The NAD83(HARN)\/Washington South (ftUS) projection is used (EPSG:2927). Vector data are provided in shapefile or comma-delimited text file formats. Geographic coordinates, where provided, are in WGS84. A readme file accompanies each folder and provides an overview and description of the enclosed data.\n\nThe heat model combines 5 intermediate raster layers (which are included in the download package): temperature gradient wells, young volcanic vents, hot springs, young intrusive volcanic rocks, and geothermometry. The permeability model combines 8 intermediate raster layers: density of mapped faults, 2D dilation tendency of mapped faults, 2D slip tendency of mapped faults, seismicity, 3D dilation tendency, 3D slip tendency, 3D maximum coulomb shear stress, and 3D slip gradients. The fluid-filled fracture model combines up to 4 intermediate rasters: resistivity from magneto-telluric 3D inversions, seismicity, Vp\/Vs anomalies from passive seismic tomography, and Vs anomalies from ambient-noise tomography.\n\nA statewide infrastructure model is also provided that formalizes land-use constraints and restrictions relevant for geothermal prospecting and development. This model combines 10 intermediate rasters: areas off limits to drilling, existing or proposed geothermal leases, DNR-owned land, land-use restrictions along the Columbia River Gorge, areas inundated by water, availability of potential process water, proximity to existing roads, proximity to transmission lines, distance from urban areas, and snow-related elevation restrictions.\n\nSupporting vector data for the development of each raster layer is provided.\n\nFor details on the areas of interest and modeling process please see the 'WA_State_Play_Fairway_Phase_2_Technical_Report' in the download package.","fullName":"Alex Steely","email":"alex.steely@dnr.wa.gov","phone":"3609021471","publisher":"Washington Geological Survey","publicationDate":{"sec":1512630000,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Geothermal Play-Fairway Analysis of Washington State Prospects","projectNumber":"EE0006728","projectLead":"Eric Hass","authors":[{"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Steely","affiliation":"Washington Geological Survey"},{"firstName":"Corina","lastName":"Forson","affiliation":"Washington Geological Survey"},{"firstName":"Trenton","lastName":"Cladouhos","affiliation":"AltaRock Energy Inc"},{"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Swyer","affiliation":"AltaRock Energy Inc"},{"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Davatzes","affiliation":"Temple University"},{"firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Anderson","affiliation":"Colorado College"},{"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Ritzinger","affiliation":"U.S. Geological Survey"},{"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Glen","affiliation":"U.S. Geological Survey"},{"firstName":"Jared","lastName":"Peacock","affiliation":"U.S. Geological Survey"},{"firstName":"William","lastName":"Schermerhorn","affiliation":"Western Washington University"}],"resources":[{"name":"Heat Model Source Data.zip","size":1360675,"desc":"This folder contains the source data for the heat model.

For making the cell embedded polymer beads, we used a fluidic device by which homogenous spherical particles of 0.5 to1 mm in diameter were synthesized.

Herein, we examined the techno-economic performance of integrating a biosorption approach into a large-scale process for producing salable total rare earth oxides (TREOs) from various feedstocks.  An airlift bioractor is proposed to carry out a biosorption process mediated by bioengineered rare earth-adsorbing bacteria.  Techno-econmic asssements were compared for three distinctive categories of REE feedstocks requiring different pre-processing steps. Key parameters identified that affect profitability include REE concentration, composition of the feedstock, and costs of feedstock pretreatment and waste management.  Among the 11 specific feedstocks investigated, coal ash from the Appalachian Basin was projected to be the most profitable, largely due to its high-value REE content.  Its cost breakdown includes pre-processing (primarily leaching) (8077.71%), biosorption (1619.04%), and oxalic acid precipitation and TREO roasting (3.35%). Surprisingly, biosorption from the high-grade Bull Hill REE ore is less profitable due to high material cost and low production revenue. Overall, our results confirmed that the application of biosorption to low-grade feedstocks for REE recovery is economically viable.

In this work we present rare earth element (REE) and trace metal behavior in produced water from four Wyoming oil and gas fields and surface ash pond water from two coal-fired power stations. Using the methods of the INL team members, we measured REEs in high salinity oil and gas produced waters. Our results show that REEs exist as a dissolved species in all waters measured for this project, typically within the parts per trillion range.","fullName":"Scott Quillinan","email":"scottyq@uwyo.edu","phone":"3077666697","publisher":"University of Wyoming","publicationDate":{"sec":1485932400,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Assessing rare earth element concentrations in geothermal and oil and gas produced waters: A potential domestic source of strategic mineral commodities","projectNumber":"EE0007603","projectLead":"Holly Thomas","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Nye","affiliation":"University of Wyoming"},{"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Quillinan","affiliation":"University of Wyoming"},{"firstName":"Ghanashyam","lastName":"Neupane","affiliation":"Idaho National Labaoratory"},{"firstName":"Travis","lastName":"McLing","affiliation":"Idaho National Laboratory"}],"resources":[{"name":"Stanford Geothermal Workshop Paper.pdf","size":1151905,"desc":"Paper describing rare earth element and trace metal concentration in Wyoming oil and gas produced waters.","tier":1,"actualName":"Nye et al_REE.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1485932400,"usec":0},"coordinates":[42.979062297932,-107.96668125],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[45.394018356584,-103.7095296875],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[40.564106239281,-112.2238328125]}},{"name":"SGW Presentation.pdf","size":2796063,"desc":"Presentation of REE in oil and gas produced waters","tier":1,"actualName":"NYE-Stanford2017-GeothermalREEs.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"presentation","sampleDate":{"sec":1487055600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[42.979062297932,-107.96668125],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[45.394018356584,-103.7095296875],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[40.564106239281,-112.2238328125]}}],"keywords":["geothermal","energy","Rare earth elements","geochemistry","produced water","brine","oil and gas","REE","trace metal","coal","concentration","coproduced"],"created":"06\/14\/2017","updated":[{"sec":1497467867,"usec":0},{"sec":1497468177,"usec":0},{"sec":1498080725,"usec":0},{"sec":1498082068,"usec":0},{"sec":1571107658,"usec":0}],"status":"Publicly accessible","userId":25257,"xdrId":930,"submitted":{"sec":1497468177,"usec":0},"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"59373979a01d478779fd6982"},"submissionName":"Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) Data for Periodic Hydraulic Tests","abstract":"California State University Long Beach evaluated hydraulic connectivity among geothermal wells using Periodic Hydraulic Testing (PHT) and Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS).

Collaborators included Cornell University, Southern Methodist University, and West Virginia University. As a result of the research, 'play fairways' were identified for further study, based on four risk criteria: 1) the Thermal Resource Quality, 2) the Natural Reservoir Quality, 3) the Risk of Seismic Activity, and the 4) Utilization Viability. \n\nIn addition to the final report document, this submission includes project 'memos' referred to throughout the report. Many of these same memos are also provided in the submissions with the detailed data products accompanying the relevant risk factor (thermal, reservoir, seismicity, and utilization). This report updates a preliminary version submitted in late 2015 (Submission 559 - See \"Reservoir Analysis 2015\" below)\n\nThis file presents the Final Report and Supporting Documents for a Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis of the Appalachian Basin sectors of New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The purpose of this Department of Energy funded effort was to assess the potential for viable low temperature (50-150 degrees C) geothermal energy exploration and development using the methods of Play Fairway Analysis. The resources analyzed occur at depths of 1000 m and greater below the surface, and the application scenarios considered are for direct utilization of the heat. This report illustrates the lateral variability of each of the four risk criteria. This report also illustrates multiple alternative methods to combine those factors in order to communicate the estimated overall favorability of geothermal development. Uncertainty in the risk estimation is also quantified. Based on these metrics, geothermal plays in the Appalachian Basin were identified as potentially viable for a variety of direct-use-heat applications. The methodologies developed in this project and presented in this report may be applied in other sedimentary basins as a foundation for geothermal resource, risk, and uncertainty assessment. Accompanying this report is an Appendix that describes in greater detail the methods used in the analysis, and 17 other technical memos that document criteria, methods and decisions on which the final product was built.","fullName":"Teresa E.

In addition, effective pressures were determined to be lower for three control experiments (deionized water-carbon dioxide, DIW-CO2). Therefore, we revised values of permeability and effective pressure as well as performed additional lab-scale stimulation experiments under identical conditions to further verify\/update the deductions presented in the discussion section.

Geothermal heat can be an ideal thermal-energy source for MD desalination technology, with a projected target range of $1\/m3 to $2\/m3 for desalinated water depending on the cost of heat. In order to estimate levelized cost of heat (LCOH) for integration of MD desalination technology with low-grade geothermal heat, three different cases were analyzed: (1) residual heat from injection brine at a geothermal power plant, (2) existing underutilized low-temperature wells, and (3) drilling new wells for low-temperature resources.

Several studies published over the past 40 years have provided assessments of the resource potential for multiple types of low-temperature geothermal systems (e.g., hydrothermal convection, hydrothermal conduction, enhanced geothermal systems) with varying temperature ranges and depths. This paper provides a summary and additional analysis of these assessments of shallow (\u2264 3 km), low-temperature (30\u00b0\u2013150\u00b0C) geothermal resources in the United States that are suitable for use in direct-use applications. This analysis considers six types of geothermal systems, spanning both hydrothermal and enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). We outline the primary data sources and quantitative parameters used to describe resources in each of these categories and present summary statistics of the total resources available. In sum, we find that low-temperature hydrothermal resources and EGS resources contain approximately 8 million and 800 million TWh of heat-in-place, respectively.

The 2011 data was based on 99 soundings that were centered on the West Flank geothermal prospect. The new soundings along with previous data from 2003 and 2006 were incorporated into a 3D inversion. Full impedance tensor data were inverted in the 1-3000 Hz range. The modelling report notes several noise sources, specifically the DC powerline that is 20,000 feet west of the survey area, and may have affected data in the 0.02 to 10 Hz range. Model cell dimensions of 450 x 450 x 65 feet were used to avoid computational instability in the 3D model. The fit between calculated and observed MT values for the final model run had an RMS value of 1.807. The included figure from the WesternGeco report shows the sounding locations from the 2011, 2006 and 2003 surveys.","fullName":"Doug

This has resulted in a unique resource: an extensive set of surficial and subsurface information appropriate to constrain the baseline structure of, and conditions within a high heat capacity magmatically hosted geothermal system.\n\nIn 2012 and 2014 AltaRock Energy conducted repeated stimulation of an enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) prospect along the western flank of the Newberry Volcano. A surface based monitoring effort was conducted independent of these stimulation attempts in both 2012 and 2014 through a collaboration between NETL, Oregon State University and Zonge International. This program included utilization of 3-D and 4-D magnetotelluric, InSAR, ground-based interferometric radar, and microgravity observations within and surrounding the planned EGS stimulation zone. These observations as well as borehole and microseismic stress field and location solutions provided by AltaRock and its collaborators, in combination with well logs, petrologic and geochemical data sets, LIDAR mapping of fault traces and extrusive volcanics, surficial geologic mapping and seismic tomography, have resulted in development of a framework, subsurface geologic model for Newberry Volcano.\n\nThe Newberry subsurface geologic model is a three-dimensional digital model constructed in EarthVision that enables lithology, directly and remotely measured material properties, and derived properties such as permeability, porosity and temperature, to be coregistered. This provides a powerful tool for characterizing and evaluating the sustainability of the site for EGS production and testing, particularly within the data-dense western portion of the volcano. The model has implications for understanding the previous EGS stimulations at Newberry as well as supporting future research and resource characterization opportunities. A portion of the Newberry area has been selected as a candidate site for the DOE FORGE (Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy) Program through a collaboration between Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Oregon State University, AltaRock Energy and additional partners. Thus, the conceptual geologic model presented here will support and benefit from future enhancements associated with that\neffort. --Mark-Moser et al. 2016","fullName":"Kelly Rose","email":"kelly.rose@netl.doe.gov","publisher":"National Energy Technology Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1456124400,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Novel use of 4D Monitoring Techniques to Improve Reservoir Longevity and Productivity in Enhanced Geothermal Systems","projectNumber":"FY11 AOP 11113","projectLead":"Lauren Boyd","hasConsent":"1","resources":[{"name":"SGW Paper","desc":"Links to the publication \"A Conceptual Geologic Model..

Model grid spacing is 250m. \n\nThe temperature model for the Coso geothermal field used over 100 geothermal production sized wells and intermediate-depth temperature holes. At the near surface of this model, two boundary temperatures were assumed:  (1) areas with surface manifestations, including fumaroles along the northeast striking normal faults and northwest striking dextral faults with the hydrothermal field, a temperature of ~104 deg C was applied to datum at +1066 meters above sea level elevation, and (2) a near-surface temperature at about 10 meters depth, of 20 deg C was applied below the diurnal and annual conductive temperature perturbations. These assumptions were based on heat flow studies conducted at the CVF and for the Mojave Desert. \nOn the edges of the hydrothermal system, a 73 deg C\/km temperature gradient contour was established using conductive gradient data from shallow and intermediate-depth temperature holes. This contour was continued to all elevation datums between the 20 deg C surface and -1520 meters below mean sea level. Because the West Flank is outside of the geothermal field footprint, during Phase 1, the three wells inside the FORGE site were incorporated into the preexisting temperature model. \n\nTo ensure a complete model was built based on all the available data sets, measured bottom-hole temperature gradients in certain wells were downward extrapolated to the next deepest elevation datum (or a maximum of about 25% of the well depth where conductive gradients are evident in the lower portions of the wells). After assuring that the margins of the geothermal field were going to be adequately modelled, the data was contoured using the Kriging method algorithm. Although the extrapolated temperatures and boundary conditions are not rigorous, the calculated temperatures are anticipated to be within ~6 deg C (20 deg F), or one contour interval, of the observed data within the Coso geothermal field.  Based on a lack of temperature data west of 74-2TCH, the edges of this model still seem to have an effect on West Flank modeled temperatures.\n","fullName":"Doug Blankenship","email":"dblank@sandia.gov","phone":"5052841230","publisher":"Sandia National Laboratories","publicationDate":{"sec":1456815600,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy: Coso, California","projectNumber":"EE0007156","projectLead":"Lauren Boyd","hasConsent":"1","resources":[{"name":"West Flank 3D Temperature Model.txt","size":618356,"desc":"x,y,z data of the 3D temperature model for the West Flank Coso FORGE site","tier":2,"actualName":"WestFlank3DTemperatureModel.txt","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"data","sampleDate":{"sec":1456815600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[35.959805485585,-117.77747226562],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[36.137214189196,-117.61822109375],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[35.782396781974,-117.9367234375]}}],"keywords":["geothermal","FORGE","EGS","West Flank","Coso","Temperature","temperature gradient","California","model","3D"],"userId":6510,"xdrId":787,"created":"04\/21\/2016","updated":[{"sec":1461267679,"usec":0},{"sec":1467750027,"usec":0},{"sec":1468948260,"usec":0},{"sec":1468948271,"usec":0},{"sec":1470774043,"usec":0},{"sec":1516734017,"usec":0},{"sec":1573781176,"usec":0},{"sec":1573781458,"usec":0},{"sec":1573781476,"usec":0}],"status":"Publicly accessible","DOI":"10.15121\/1287561","submitted":{"sec":1461267679,"usec":0},"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":true,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"57192bc9a01d473144c80db9"},"submissionName":"West Flank Coso FORGE: Downhole Lithologic Data","abstract":"x,y,z downhole lithologic logs for the wells in and around the West Flank FORGE site based on a review of cuttings, core, and mud logs.

Beneath Newberry Volcano is one of the largest geothermal heat reservoirs in the western United States, extensively studied for the last 40 years. The large, shallow (200 deg C at less than 2 km depth), conductive thermal anomaly has already been well characterized by extensive drilling and geophysical surveys. Four deep (greater than 3,000 m) boreholes completed on the leasehold currently managed by AltaRock have conductive thermal gradients with bottom hole temperatures above 320 deg C. Three large geothermal pads and two deep geothermal wells exist on the leasehold as well as eight, 200-290 m deep monitoring boreholes that have been used for seismic monitoring and sampling of shallow groundwater. All these investments have built the scientific foundation that establishes the site as high EGS potential, demonstrates a record of addressing potential risks (induced seismicity, wildlife, groundwater, etc.), and has developed true support and engagement with the local and regional communities. The high temperatures at relatively shallow depths at the site will allow a greater variety of drilling methods to be tested and a greater share of funds to be reserved for non-drilling activities.","fullName":"Alain Bonneville","email":"alain.bonneville@pnnl.gov","publisher":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1456124400,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy: Newberry, OR","projectNumber":"EE0007158","projectLead":"Lauren Boyd","hasConsent":"1","resources":[{"name":"Publication","desc":"Links to publication from Stanford Geothermal Workshop 2016-- FORGE at Newberry","tier":1,"resourceType":"link","isLocal":false,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1456124400,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Newberry Caldera Geothermal Area","coordinates":[43.71666667,-121.2333333],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[43.91666667,-121.0333333],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[43.51666667,-121.4333333]},"URI":"https:\/\/pangea.stanford.edu\/ERE\/db\/GeoConf\/papers\/SGW\/2016\/Bonneville.pdf"}],"keywords":["geothermal","EGS","enhanced geothermal system","NEWGEN","FORGE","Newberry","Oregon"],"userId":22970,"xdrId":780,"created":"04\/20\/2016","updated":[{"sec":1461182179,"usec":0},{"sec":1462474729,"usec":0},{"sec":1466715441,"usec":0},{"sec":1468946620,"usec":0},{"sec":1516729349,"usec":0},{"sec":1516729505,"usec":0}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submitted":{"sec":1461182179,"usec":0},"authors":[{"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Bonneville","affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Trenton T.","lastName":"Cladouhos","affiliation":"AltaRock Energy Inc"},{"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Schultz","affiliation":"Oregon State University"}],"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"5717de01a01d477e61cc7a9b"},"submissionName":"A Thermal-Hydrological-Chemical Model for the EGS Demonstration Project at Newberry Volcano, OR","abstract":"Newberry Volcano in Central Oregon is the site of a Department of Energy funded Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) Demonstration Project. Stimulation and production of an EGS is a strong perturbation to the physical and chemical environment, giving rise to coupled Thermal-Hydrological-Mechanical-Chemical (THMC) processes leading to permeability changes as a result of mineral dissolution and precipitation, rock deformation, and fracture reactivation. To evaluate these processes, and to help guide EGS stimulation and reservoir development strategies, a combined native-state and reservoir model of the west flank of Newberry Volcano was created that encompasses the planned stimulation zone and a several km region of the west flank from the surface down to the supercritical region, likely close to a postulated cooling intrusive body. Temperature and pressure distributions were first modeled using TOUGHREACT with boundary conditions estimated from nearby drill holes, and compared to measurements made in the over 3 km deep NWG 55-29 drill hole. With estimates of the porosity and heat capacities for the major hydrogeologic units, thermal conductivities were calibrated by matching to the measured temperature profile. To simulate the development of the observed hydrothermal mineralogy, a reaction-transport model (THC) was developed using the pre-alteration mineralogy and shallow groundwater chemistry as the initial geochemical conditions, assuming that modeled temperature and pressure distributions were relatively constant over several thousand years. Close correspondence of modeled and observed epidote distributions support the observation that past hydrothermal activity took place under thermal gradients similar to current values, whereas calcite and sulfide abundances at depth likely require a magmatic gas component. Multicomponent geothermometry was used to estimate potential temperatures of equilibration of waters, and to evaluate the effects of kinetics on calculated mineral equilibration temperatures. The ultimate goal will be to capture both the local chemical and mechanical changes in the rock owing to stimulation as well as the potential long-term response and sustainability of the larger-scale geothermal reservoir.","fullName":"Kelly Rose","email":"kelly.rose@netl.doe.gov","publisher":"National Energy Technology Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1327906800,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Novel

advances designed to reduce the cost of power generated by EGS in a hot, dry well (NWG 55-29) drilled in 2008. First, the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second, to stimulate multiple zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection\/ production profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced seismicity. An initial stimulation was conducted in 2012 and continued for 7 weeks, with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Further analysis indicated a shallow casing leak and an unstable formation in the open hole. The well was repaired with a shallow casing tieback and perforated liner in the open hole and re-stimulated in 2014. The second stimulation started September 23rd, 2014 and continued for 3 weeks with over 9,500 m3 of water injected. The well was treated with several batches of newly tested TZIM diverter materials and a newly designed Diverter Injection Vessel Assembly (DIVA), which was the main modification to the original injection system design used in 2012. A second round of stimulation that included two perforation shots and additional batches of TZIM was conducted on November 11th, 2014 for 9 days with an additional 4,000 m3 of water injected. The stimulations resulted in a 3-4 fold increase in injectivity, and PTS data indicates partial blocking and creation of flow zones near the bottom of the well.","fullName":"Trenton T.

Second, to stimulate multiple zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection\/ production profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced seismicity. Stimulation started October 17, 2012 and continued for 7 weeks, with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Two TZIM treatments successfully shifted the depth of stimulation. Injectivity, DTS, and seismic analysis indicate that fracture permeability in well NWG 55-29 was enhanced by two orders of magnitude.","fullName":"Trenton T.

The image log reveals an extensive network of fractures in a conjugate set striking approximately N-S and dipping 50 deg that are well oriented for normal slip and are consistent with surface-breaking regional normal faults in the vicinity. Similarly,\nbreakouts indicate a consistent minimum horizontal stress, Shmin, azimuth of 092.3 +\/- 17.3 deg. In conjunction with a suite of geophysical logs, a model of the stress magnitudes constrained by the width of breakouts at depth and a model of rock strength independently indicates a predominantly normal faulting stress regime.","fullName":"Kelly Rose","email":"kelly.rose@netl.doe.gov","publisher":"National Energy Technology Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1293865200,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Novel use of 4D Monitoring Techniques to Improve Reservoir Longevity and Productivity in Enhanced Geothermal Systems","projectNumber":"FY11 AOP 11113","projectLead":"Lauren Boyd","hasConsent":"1","resources":[{"name":"GRC Paper.pdf","size":1868055,"desc":"Preliminary Analysis of Stress in the Newberry EGS Well NWG 55-29","tier":1,"actualName":"davatzes-and-hickman-2011.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1293865200,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Newberry Caldera Geothermal Area","coordinates":[43.71666667,-121.2333333],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[43.91666667,-121.0333333],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[43.51666667,-121.4333333]}}],"keywords":["geothermal","EGS","enhanced geothermal system","Newberry","Oregon","NEWGEN","stress analysis","well data","enhanced geothermal systems","stress","publication","monitoring","4D"],"userId":22970,"xdrId":737,"created":"03\/26\/2016","updated":[{"sec":1458972572,"usec":0},{"sec":1460665343,"usec":0},{"sec":1465172854,"usec":0},{"sec":1502908334,"usec":0},{"sec":1509664528,"usec":0},{"sec":1509665113,"usec":0},{"sec":1509665188,"usec":0},{"sec":1509665203,"usec":0},{"sec":1573757898,"usec":0}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submitted":{"sec":1458972572,"usec":0},"authors":[{"firstName":"Nicholas C.","lastName":"Davatzes","affiliation":"Temple University"},{"firstName":"Stephen H.","lastName":"Hickman","affiliation":"United States Geological Survey"}],"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"56f5b03c6276889f12000031"},"submissionName":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis - Volcanic Vents, Lacustrine Sediments, and post-Miocene Faults KMZ files ","abstract":"This dataset contain raw data files in kmz files (Google Earth georeference format).

Because 11 wells in the eastern section of the study area (in and around the Mineral Mountains) are at higher elevations compared to those closer to the center of the basin, temperature profiles were extrapolated to a constant elevation of 200 m below the 1830 m (6000 ft) a.s.l. datum (approximate elevation of alluvial fans at the base of the Mineral Mountains) to smooth the contours across the ridges and valleys.

Collaborators included Cornell University, Southern Methodist University, and West Virginia University.  As a result of the research, 'play fairways' were identified for further study, based on four 'risk' criteria:  1) the Thermal Resource Quality, 2) the Natural Reservoir Quality, 3) the Risk of Seismic Activity, and the 4) Utilization Viability.  \n\nIn addition to the final report document, this submission includes project 'memos' referred to throughout the report.  Many of these same memos are also provided in the submission with the detailed data products accompanying the relevant risk factor (thermal, reservoir, seismicity, and utilization). \n\nA portion of the executive overview follows: \n\nGeothermal energy is an attractive sustainable energy source. Project developers need confirmation of the resource base to warrant their time and financial resources.  The hydrocarbon industry has addressed exploration and development complexities through use of a technique referred to as Play Fairway Analysis (PFA). The PFA technique assigns risk metrics that communicate the favorability of potential hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs in order to enable prudent allocation of exploration and development resources.  \n\nThe purpose of this Department of Energy funded effort is to apply the PFA approach to geothermal exploration and development, thus providing a technique for Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis (GPFA). This project focuses on four risk factors of concern for direct-use geothermal plays in the Appalachian Basin (AB) portions of New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia (Figure 1). These risk factors are 1) thermal resource quality, 2) natural reservoir quality, 3) induced seismicity, and 4) utilization opportunities (Figure 2).  This research expands upon and updates methodologies used in previous assessments of the potential for geothermal fields and utilization in the Appalachian Basin, and also introduces novel approaches and metrics for quantification of geothermal reservoir productivity in sedimentary basins. Unique to this project are several methodologies for combining the risk factors into a single commensurate objective that communicates the estimated overall favorability of geothermal development. Uncertainty in the risk estimation is also quantified. Based on these metrics, geothermal plays in the Appalachian Basin were identified as potentially viable for a variety of direct-use-heat applications. The methodologies developed in this project may be applied in other sedimentary basins as a foundation for low temperature (50-150 degC), direct use geothermal resource, risk, and uncertainty assessment. Through our identification of plays, this project reveals the potential for widespread assessment of low-temperature geothermal energy from sedimentary basins as an alternative to current heating sources that are unsustainable.\n\nThere is an important distinction in this Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis project as compared to hydrothermal projects: this Appalachian Basin analysis is focused on the direct use of the heat, rather than on electrical production. Lindal (1973) illuminated numerous industrial and other low-temperature applications of geothermal energy for which this analysis can be useful.  The major relationship to electricity is that direct-use applications reduce the electricity requirements for a region.  Even though all of the geothermal resources in the Appalachian Basin are low grade, the high population and high heating demand across New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia translate into economic advantages if geothermal direct-use heating replaces electricity-based heating. The advantage is derived from the high efficiency of extracting heat from geothermal fluids rather than converting the fluids to electricity (Tester et al., 2015).\n","created":"01\/13\/2016","email":"tej1@cornell.edu","fullName":"Teresa E.

The oil and gas industry activity within the Appalachian Basin is a wealth of temperature at depth data, as 'raw' or uncorrected Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT) values are routinely collected during the oil and gas drilling and\/or extraction process. However, BHT can differ from true in-situ rock values due to drilling disturbances, circulation of fluids, and other human induced factors. Additionally, extreme terrain variations as seen in mountainous areas can impact accurate determination of geothermal gradient. For these reasons, BHT values are generally \u2018corrected\u2019 to approximate an equilibrium temperature-depth profile.

In practice, it is infeasible to know the conductivity stratigraphy everywhere, so approximations are needed. For this project, the Correlation of Stratigraphic Units of North America (COSUNA) stratigraphic columns, available from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists were used as approximations of the stratigraphy because 1) well specific stratigraphy is not available for every well, and 2) the time constraints of Phase 1 would not be conducive to implementing specific geology to each well.

Absent a regionally complete map of deep faults, gravity and magnetic data are analyzed to extract a multi-scale-edge Poisson wavelet representation of the locations of rocks of laterally contrasting physical properties. Among these lateral rock property boundaries are a subset that are candidates for future fault slip, if fluid pressures change and if a plane of weakness is properly oriented in space. To narrow the focus of this analysis onto rock property boundaries of greater concern (e.g., faults with demonstrated propensity to slip), a second step was to identify the co-occurrence of rock-property-boundaries at depths of 3-4 km and seismic activity registered in earthquake catalogs or by EarthScope. One approach to exploring the likelihood that some of the faults in the region might be reactivated if subsurface pressures change is an analysis of tendency to slip, which is based on determination of the spatial orientation of a structure (plane of weakness) relative to the direction of the regional principal compressive stress. This method will produce interesting results that foster further investigation although at this stage the results will be of low reliability as indicators of the risk of induced seismicity.

The channelized flow pattern associated with ubiquitous heterogeneity in fracture aperture distribution causes non-uniform temperature decrease in the rock body, which makes the flow increasingly concentrated into some preferential paths through the action of thermal stress. This mechanism may cause rapid heat production deterioration of EGS reservoirs.\nIn this study, we investigated the effects of aperture heterogeneity on flow pattern evolution in a single fracture in a low-permeability crystalline formation. We developed a numerical model on the platform of GEOS to simulate the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical processes in a penny-shaped fracture accessed via an injection well and a production well. We find that aperture heterogeneity generally exacerbates flow channeling and reservoir performance generally decreases with longer correlation length of aperture field. The expected production life is highly variable (5 years to beyond 30 years) when the aperture correlation length is longer than 1\/5 of the well distance, whereas a heterogeneous fracture behaves similar to a homogeneous one when the correlation length is much shorter than the well distance. Besides, the mean production life decreases with greater aperture standard deviation only when the correlation length is relatively long. Although flow channeling is inevitable, initial aperture fields and well locations that enable tortuous preferential paths tend to prolong heat production lives.\n","fullName":"Charles Carrigan","email":"carrigan1@llnl.gov","phone":"925.422.3941","publisher":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1447570800,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Validation of EGS Feasibility and Explosive Fracturing Techniques","projectNumber":"FY15 AOP 1.3.2.4","projectLead":"Elisabet Metcalfe","hasConsent":"1","resources":[{"name":"Geothermics Manuscript.pdf","size":1388561,"desc":"Geothermics manuscrpt titled \"Thermal Drawdown-Induced Flow Channeling in a Single Fracture in EGS\"","tier":1,"actualName":"GEOT-D-15-00086R1_Manuscript(1).pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1441087200,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Geysers Geothermal Area","coordinates":[38.8,-122.8],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[39,-122.6],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[38.6,-123]}}],"keywords":["geothermal","thermal drawdown","single fracture system","thermomechanical coupling","flow channeling","reservoir simulation","EGS","engineered geothermal systems","geothermics","heat production","single fracture","thermomechanical"],"userId":4955,"created":"11\/25\/2015","updated":[{"sec":1448519728,"usec":0},{"sec":1449161816,"usec":0},{"sec":1450199968,"usec":0},{"sec":1450298909,"usec":0},{"sec":1502483189,"usec":0},{"sec":1502483636,"usec":0}],"status":"Publicly accessible","xdrId":655,"submitted":{"sec":1448519728,"usec":0},"authors":[{"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Guo","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Fu","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Hao","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Catherine A.","lastName":"Peters","affiliation":"Princeton University"},{"firstName":"Charles R.","lastName":"Carrigan","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"}],"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"5656a3176276880603000023"},"submissionName":"Thermal Drawdown Induced Flow Channeling in Fractured Geothermal Reservoirs: Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering","abstract":"We investigate the flow-channeling phenomenon caused by thermal drawdown in fractured geothermal reservoirs. A discrete fracture network-based, fully coupled thermal \"hydrological\" mechanical simulator is used to study the interactions between fluid flow, temperature change, and the associated rock deformation. The responses of a number of randomly generated 2D fracture networks that represent a variety of reservoir characteristics are simulated with various injection-production well distances. We find that flow channeling, namely flow concentration in cooled zones, is the inevitable fate of all the scenarios evaluated. We also identify a secondary geomechanical mechanism caused by the anisotropy in thermal stress that counteracts the primary mechanism of flow channeling. This new mechanism tends, to some extent, to result in a more diffuse flow distribution, although it is generally not strong enough to completely reverse flow channeling. We find that fracture intensity substantially affects the overall hydraulic impedance of the reservoir but increasing fracture intensity generally does not improve heat production performance. Increasing the injection-production well separation appears to be an effective means to prolong the production life of a reservoir.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00603-015-0776-0.\n","fullName":"Charles Carrigan","email":"carrigan1@llnl.gov","phone":"925.422.3941","publisher":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1447570800,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Validation of EGS Feasibility and Explosive Fracturing Techniques","projectNumber":"FY15 AOP 1.3.2.4","projectLead":"Elisabet Metcalfe","hasConsent":"1","resources":[{"name":"RMRE Peer Review Paper.pdf","size":17698438,"desc":"Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering paper titled \u201cThermal drawdown-induced flow channeling in fractured geothermal reservoirs\u201d","tier":1,"actualName":"RMRE_FlowChannel_Preview (1).pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1433138400,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Geysers Geothermal Area","coordinates":[38.8,-122.8],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[39,-122.6],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[38.6,-123]}}],"keywords":["geothermal","thermal drawdown","flow channeling","thermomechanical coupling","reservoir simulation","stimulation","egs","enhanced geothermal reservoirs","explosive fracturing"],"userId":4955,"created":"11\/25\/2015","updated":[{"sec":1448518423,"usec":0},{"sec":1450199816,"usec":0},{"sec":1450199895,"usec":0},{"sec":1450298857,"usec":0},{"sec":1502481388,"usec":0},{"sec":1502481598,"usec":0},{"sec":1502481849,"usec":0},{"sec":1502482229,"usec":0},{"sec":1502482252,"usec":0}],"status":"Publicly accessible","xdrId":654,"submitted":{"sec":1448518423,"usec":0},"authors":[{"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Fu","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Charles R.","lastName":"Carrigan","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Stuart D.

Phase 1 of the GPFA-AB project identified potential Geothermal Play Fairways within the Appalachian basin of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New York.  This was accomplished through analysis of 4 key criteria: thermal quality, natural reservoir productivity, risk of seismicity, and heat utilization.  Each of these analyses represent a distinct project task, with the fifth task encompassing combination of the 4 risks factors.  Supporting data for all five tasks has been uploaded into the Geothermal Data Repository node of the National Geothermal Data System (NGDS). \n\nThis submission comprises the data for Thermal Quality Analysis (project task 1) and includes all of the necessary shapefiles, rasters, datasets, code, and references to code repositories that were used to create the thermal resource and risk factor maps as part of the GPFA-AB project. The identified Geothermal Play Fairways are also provided with the larger dataset. Figures (.png) are provided as examples of the shapefiles and rasters. The regional standardized 1 square km grid used in the project is also provided as points (cell centers), polygons, and as a raster. Two ArcGIS toolboxes are available: 1) RegionalGridModels.tbx for creating resource and risk factor maps on the standardized grid, and 2) ThermalRiskFactorModels.tbx for use in making the thermal resource maps and cross sections. These toolboxes contain item description documentation for each model within the toolbox, and for the toolbox itself. This submission also contains three R scripts: 1) AddNewSeisFields.R to add seismic risk data to attribute tables of seismic risk, 2) StratifiedKrigingInterpolation.R for the interpolations used in the thermal resource analysis, and 3) LeaveOneOutCrossValidation.R for the cross validations used in the thermal interpolations.\n\nSome file descriptions make reference to various 'memos'.

This was calculated using a modification of a program called GEOPHIRES, available at http:\/\/koenraadbeckers.net\/geophires\/index.php. The MATLAB modules used in conjunction with GEOPHIRES, the MATLAB data input file, the GEOPHIRES output data file, and an explanation of the software components have been provided.

For each of the 4 image (.png) files, there is an accompanying georeferenced TIF (.tif) file by the same name.\nIn addition to calculating SLCOH, this Task 4 also identified many sites that may be prospects for use of a geothermal district heating system, based on their size and industry, rather than on the SLCOH.

First, the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second, to stimulate multiple zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection\/ production profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced seismicity. An initial stimulation was conducted in 2012 and continued for 7 weeks, with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Further analysis indicated a shallow casing leak and an unstable formation in the open hole. The well was repaired with a shallow casing tieback and perforated liner in the open hole and re-stimulated in 2014. The second stimulation started September 23rd, 2014 and continued for 3 weeks with over 9,500 m3 of water injected. The well was treated with several batches of newly tested TZIM diverter materials and a newly designed Diverter Injection Vessel Assembly (DIVA), which was the main modification to the original injection system design used in 2012. A second round of stimulation that included two perforation shots and additional batches of TZIM was conducted on November 11th, 2014 for 9 days with an additional 4,000 m3 of water injected. The stimulations resulted in a 3-4 fold increase in injectivity, and PTS data indicates partial blocking and creation of flow zones near the bottom of the well.\n\nThis submission includes all of the files and reports associated with the stimulation, pressure testing, and monitoring included in the scope of the project.","fullName":"Trenton T.

Two deep exploration test wells were drilled by Davenport on the west flank of the volcano, one intersected a hydrothermal system; the other intersected isolated fractures with no hydrothermal interconnection. Both holes have bottom-hole temperatures near or above 315 deg C (600 deg F). Subsequent to deep test drilling an expanded exploration and evaluation program was initiated. These efforts have included reprocessing existing data, executing multiple geological, geophysical, geochemical programs, deep exploration test well drilling and shallow well drilling. The efforts over the last three years have been made possible through the DOE's facilitation of innovative geothermal exploration techniques. The combined results of the last 8 years have led to a better understanding of the history and complexity of Newberry Volcano and improved the design and interpretation of geophysical exploration techniques with regard to blind geothermal resources in volcanic terrain.","created":"04\/14\/2015","email":"catherine@smu.edu","fullName":"Cathy Chickering Pace","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","Newberry","Newberry Volcano","Davenport","AltaRock","exploration","drilling","investigation","site","structural","blind geothermal system","volcanic","terrain","Oregon","IET"],"phone":"2147681510","projectLead":"Eric Hass","projectNumber":"EE0002833","projectTitle":"DOE Innovative Exploration Technology (IET) Grant 109 program supporting geothermal exploration of Newberry Volcano, Oregon","publicationDate":{"sec":1420095600,"usec":0},"publisher":"Southern Methodist University","resources":[{"name":"Final Report with Appendices.pdf","size":40996752,"desc":"Final Summary Report of geothermal exploration at Newberry Volcano.

This addition, which translates to more than 5 GW of generation capacity, is anticipated because of technological advances and an increase in available sources through the continued development of enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs) and low-temperature resources (EIA 2013). Studies have shown that air emissions, water consumption, and land use for geothermal electricity generation have less of an impact than traditional fossil fuel-based electricity generation; however, the long-term sustainability of geothermal power plants can be affected by insufficient replacement of aboveground or belowground operational fluid losses resulting from normal operations (Schroeder et al. 2014). Thus, access to water is therefore critical for increased deployment of EGS technologies and, therefore, growth of the geothermal sector. This paper examines water issues relating to EGS development from a variety of perspectives. It starts by exploring the relationship between EGS site geology, stimulation protocols, and below ground water loss, which is one of the largest drivers of water consumption for EGS projects.  It then examines the relative costs of different potential traditional and alternative water sources for EGS. Finally it summarizes specific state policies relevant to the use of alternative water sources for EGS, and finally explores the relationship between EGS site geology, stimulation protocols, and below ground water loss, which is one of the largest drivers of water consumption for EGS projects.

This study is part of a hydrogeologic and geochemical study of the Black Canyon thermal springs by the U.S. Geological Survey, funded by the National Park Service and National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. The study consisted of (1) compilation of existing geologic mapping, augmented by new field geologic mapping and geochronology (Felger and others, 2014), (2) collection and analysis of structural data adjacent to the springs of interest (appendix 1; Anderson and Beard, 2011; Beard and others, 2011a), and (3) construction of regional cross sections (pl. 1). The most significant results identify faults, fracture zones, and rock characteristics that influence the hydrogeology of Black Canyon. Additional results include refinement of the volcanic stratigraphy based on field mapping and new geochronology. This report will be integrated into a companion hydrogeologic report that includes new geochemical and spring flow data that describes groundwater components of Black Canyon thermal springs (M.

The sample diameters were 1.5\" and the sample lengths were 6\". The blind hole was 0.25\" in diameter and 3\" deep. One set of experiments measured strains at points located circumferentially around the center of the sample with identical radii to determine if there was strain variability (this would not be expected for a homogeneous material based on the symmetry of loading).

Because angle has historically been controlled by reducing weight on bit (WOB), these are often competing priorities.  The use of real time surveillance of mechanical specific energy (MSE) provided unique insights into the bit dysfunction that occurs with many practices used to control angle. These quantitative insights supported the development of BHA and operating practices that maintained low angle while also achieving major gains in drilling performance.   \n\nThe McGinness Hills field in Lander County Nevada is a geothermal operation with wells drilled in hard metamorphic and crystalline formations.  Wellbore inclinations must be maintained below 2.0 degrees in the critical 20 inch interval in order to allow use of lineshaft pumps, which is challenging in the required hole sizes and rock hardness.  Formation strengths are similar to petroleum operations in the Rockies and West Texas.  \n\nPendulum and packed-hole assemblies were tested, and straight motors and slick assemblies were used for corrections.  Well build rates were assumed to be controlled by the three-point curvature in the lower assembly and stabilizer placement was modified to control this curvature.  The effectiveness of the curvature control as WOB was increased was evaluated from inclination measurements.  Real time MSE analysis was used to manage bit operating performance and to determine the root causes of bit dysfunction.\n\nThe results demonstrated that packed-hole assemblies could be designed that controlled inclination while enabling 2-3 times higher WOB, and that the use of pendulum assemblies should be eliminated.  Packed assemblies drilled 87% faster.  The increased WOB resulted in higher drill rates, major reduction in whirl and extended bit life, which are equally important performance objectives in hard rock drilling.  The use of MSE surveillance allowed the physical processes to be understood deterministically, so that the philosophical design principles can be applied in other petroleum and geothermal operations.\n","created":"08\/27\/2014","email":"sdknuds@sandia.gov","fullName":"Steven Knudsen","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","BHA","drilling","packed BHA","Pendulum BHA"," MSE","McGinness Hills Field","WOB","bottom hole assembly","weight on bit","mechanical specific energy","SPE","inclination","angle","McGinness Hills"],"moratorium":{"releaseDate":{"sec":1498111200,"usec":0}},"phone":"505.844.7306","projectLead":"Eric Hass","projectNumber":"FY14 AOP 3.6.1.3","publicationDate":{"sec":1398837600,"usec":0},"publisher":"Sandia National Laboratories","resources":[{"name":"SPE Website.php","desc":"Society of Petroleum Engineers","tier":1,"resourceType":"link","isLocal":false,"type":"website","sampleDate":{"sec":1409119200,"usec":0},"coordinates":[40.105515184579,-117.019415625],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[42.093539458959,-115.091365625],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[38.117490910199,-118.947465625]},"URI":"http:\/\/www.spe.org\/index.php"},{"name":"SPE Paper","desc":"Link to a free version of the paper hosted by OSTI","tier":1,"resourceType":"link","isLocal":false,"type":"website","sampleDate":{"sec":1409119200,"usec":0},"coordinates":[40.105515184579,-117.019415625],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[42.093539458959,-115.091365625],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[38.117490910199,-118.947465625]},"URI":"https:\/\/www.osti.gov\/scitech\/servlets\/purl\/1315439"}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"Practices Maintain Straight Hole in Crooked Hole Conditions, While Also Enabling Significant Gains in Drill Rate","updated":[{"sec":1409156108,"usec":0},{"sec":1410190094,"usec":0},{"sec":1410191176,"usec":0},{"sec":1410278864,"usec":0},{"sec":1498224928,"usec":0},{"sec":1498225352,"usec":0},{"sec":1498225422,"usec":0}],"userId":4291,"xdrId":433,"submitted":{"sec":1409156108,"usec":0},"authors":[{"firstName":"Steven D.","lastName":"Knudsen","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Dupriest","affiliation":"Texas AM University"},{"firstName":"Ezra","lastName":"Zemach","affiliation":"Ormat Nevada Inc"},{"firstName":"Douglas A.","lastName":"Blankenship","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"}],"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"53ee78ba6276884442000000"},"abstract":"This a report for the project \"Mapping Fracture Network Creation with Microseismicity During EGS Demonstrations\". Effective enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) require optimal fracture networks for efficient heat transfer between hot rock and fluid. Microseismic mapping is a key tool used to infer the subsurface fracture geometry. Traditional earthquake detection and location techniques are often employed to identify microearthquakes in geothermal regions. However, most commonly used algorithms may miss events if the seismic signal of an earthquake is small relative to the background noise level or if a microearthquake occurs within the coda of a larger event. Consequently, we have developed a set of algorithms that provide improved microearthquake detection. Our objective is to investigate the microseismicity at the DOE Newberry EGS site to better image the active regions of the underground fracture network during and immediately after the EGS stimulation. Detection of more microearthquakes during EGS stimulations will allow for better seismic delineation of the active regions of the underground fracture system. This improved knowledge of the reservoir network will improve our understanding of subsurface conditions, and allow improvement of the stimulation strategy that will optimize heat extraction and maximize economic return. \n\nThis project is the FY14 continuation of FY13 AOP project 25728, which had its origins as the ARRA lab project AID 19981.

Completions are typically considered to be the final step of drilling engineering which includes processes such as setting casing, cementing, and perforating to reach the target formation.  Completions provide the conduit from the resource to the surface.  Although completions encompass a wide range of disciplines, several key factors ultimately determine the quality of the completion.  One of those is cementing and centralizing casing within the wellbore.\n\nThis white paper examines the current state of the art for centralizers in the context of well completions.  The paper will include an introductory primer on well completions to provide the framework for the centralizer discussions.  The types of centralizers currently available and how they are used will be discussed in addition to alternative centralizer techniques. \n","created":"05\/01\/2014","email":"jsu@sandia.gov","fullName":"Jiann Su","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","completions","cementing","centralizers","white paper","centralization","well completion","casing","completion","technology","wellbore","safety"],"projectNumber":"FY14 AOP 11027","publicationDate":{"sec":1397714400,"usec":0},"publisher":"Sandia National Laboratories","resources":[{"name":"Centralizers Paper.docx","size":7667044,"desc":"Paper discussing centralizers in the context of well completions.","tier":1,"actualName":"DPFPC_white_paper_FINAL.docx","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"text_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1398924000,"usec":0},"coordinates":[34.666378009361,-105.50574375],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[36.804231690746,-103.57769375],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[32.528524327976,-107.43379375]}}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"Centralizer for Use in Well Completions","updated":[{"sec":1398981503,"usec":0},{"sec":1399301586,"usec":0},{"sec":1498152982,"usec":0},{"sec":1498152998,"usec":0},{"sec":1580164648,"usec":0},{"sec":1580164673,"usec":0},{"sec":1580164853,"usec":0}],"userId":4293,"projectLead":"Greg Stillman","xdrId":414,"submitted":{"sec":1398981503,"usec":0},"authors":[{"firstName":"Jiann","lastName":"Su","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"}],"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"5362b3696276882211000000"},"abstract":"For enhanced or Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) geothermal brine is pumped to the surface via the production wells, the heat extracted to turn a turbine to generate electricity, and the spent brine re-injected via injection wells back underground. If designed properly, the subsurface rock formations will lead this water back to the extraction well as heated brine. Proper monitoring of these geothermal reservoirs is essential for developing and maintaining the necessary level of productivity of the field. Chemical tracers are commonly used to characterize the fracture network and determine the connectivity between the injection and production wells. Currently, most tracer experiments involve injecting the tracer at the injection well, manually collecting liquid samples at the wellhead of the production well, and sending the samples off for laboratory analysis. While this method provides accurate tracer concentration data at very low levels of detection, it does not provide information regarding the location of the fractures which were conducting the tracer between wellbores. Sandia is developing a high-temperature electrochemical sensor capable of measuring tracer concentrations and pH downhole on a wireline tool. The goal of this effort is to collect real-time pH and ionic tracer concentration data at temperatures up to 225 degrees C and pressures up to 3000 psi. \n\nIn this paper, a prototype electrochemical sensor and the initial data obtained will be presented detailing the measurement of iodide tracer concentrations at high temperature and pressure in a newly developed laboratory scale autoclave.\n","created":"05\/01\/2014","email":"ggciesl@sandia.gov","fullName":"Grzegorz Cieslewski","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","EGS","downhole tool","reservoir monitoring","chemical tracers","high temperature electrochemical sensor","high temp","high temperature","electrochemical sensor","ionic tracers","Engineered Geothermal Systems EGS","Sandia National Labs","SNL","doi: 10.1117\/12.2051151","tracer","downhole","high pressure"],"moratorium":{"releaseDate":{"sec":1498111200,"usec":0}},"phone":"505.284.2532","projectLead":"Greg Stillman","projectNumber":"FY14 AOP 1.1.5.1","publicationDate":{"sec":1396245600,"usec":0},"publisher":"Sandia National Laboratories","resources":[{"name":"SPIE Paper","desc":"Paper published by the International Society for Optics and Physics (SPIE) discussing the development of a downhole tool measuring real-time concentration of ionic tracers and pH in geothermal reservoirs.","tier":1,"resourceType":"link","isLocal":false,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1396245600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[35.036454695185,-106.63184238281],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[35.14170232763,-106.478084375],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[34.931207062739,-106.78560039063]},"URI":"http:\/\/proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org\/data\/Conferences\/SPIEP\/79800\/91130J.pdf"}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"Development of a Downhole Tool Measuring Real-Time Concentration of Ionic Tracers and pH in Geothermal Reservoirs","updated":[{"sec":1398977385,"usec":0},{"sec":1399301513,"usec":0},{"sec":1401903043,"usec":0},{"sec":1410278662,"usec":0},{"sec":1412970857,"usec":0},{"sec":1429540187,"usec":0},{"sec":1498151782,"usec":0},{"sec":1498151792,"usec":0},{"sec":1498152034,"usec":0},{"sec":1498152041,"usec":0}],"userId":6190,"projectTitle":"High Temperature Chemical Sensing Tool for Distributed Mapping of Fracture Flow in EGS","xdrId":413,"submitted":{"sec":1398977385,"usec":0},"authors":[{"firstName":"Ryan F.","lastName":"Hess","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"Timothy J.","lastName":"Boyle","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Limmer","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"William G.","lastName":"Yelton","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Bingham","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Stillman","affiliation":"United States Department of Energy"},{"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Lindblom","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Cieslewski","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"}],"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"535306a8627688d277000000"},"abstract":"Comprehensive catalogue of drill-hole data in spreadsheet, shapefile, and Geosoft database formats.

The geothermal field lies within the intersection of two regional grabens, the middle-late Miocene, north-trending, Oregon-Idaho graben and younger late Miocene to Holocene, northwest-trending, western Snake River Plain graben. It is marked by Neal Hot Springs, which effuse from opaline sinter mounds just north of Bully Creek. Production and injection wells, with temperatures up to 142 degrees C, intersect the Neal fault zone at depths of 680-1900 m and subsidiary faults within a relay ramp or step-over within the fault zone.\n\nThe stratigraphy at Neal correlates with four regional packages. Basement rocks, discovered in one well, are granite, tentatively correlated with Jurassic Olds Ferry-Izee terrane. Nonconformably above is a thick package of middle Miocene Columbia River Basalt Group lavas, regionally known as the basalt of Malheur Gorge. Conformably above are middle to late Miocene Oregon-Idaho graben lavas, volcaniclastics, fluvial and lacustrine rocks. Overlying are the youngest rocks at Neal, which are late Miocene to Pliocene, western Snake River Plain lacustrine, fluvial, and volcaniclastic rocks.\n\nThe structural framework at Neal is characterized by northerly to northweststriking normal faults, including the geothermally related Neal fault zone. Stress inversion of kinematic data reveal an extensional stress regime, including an interpreted younger, southwest-trending (~243 degrees), least principal stress and an older, west-trending (~265 degrees) least principal stress.\n\nThe geothermal field is bounded on the east by the Neal fault, a major, westdipping, north-northwest-striking, steeply dipping normal to oblique-slip fault, along which geothermal fluids ascend, and on the west by the concealed north-northweststriking, west-dipping Sugarloaf Butte fault. The Neal fault zone can be modeled into two structural settings: an interpreted older, left-stepping, normal-slip fault zone and a younger, oblique sinistral-normal zone, suggested by the earlier west-trending and later southwest-trending extensional stress regimes. Recent sinistral-normal displacement may have generated a small pull-apart basin in the Neal area and facilitated development of the geothermal system. 'Hard-linkage' between the Neal and Sugarloaf Butte faults occurs through concealed, west-northwest-striking faults, including the Cottonwood Creek subvertical fault, along which lateral fluid-flow is likely. An inferred northplunging fault intersection at the Neal Hot Springs likely controls the location of the hot springs and sinter terraces.\n\nYoung structural features are evident at Neal. The Neal fault zone cuts Quaternary fans and late Miocene lower and upper Bully Creek Formation sedimentary rocks. In addition, the geothermal field is 4 km west of the active, north- to northweststriking, normal-slip Cottonwood Mountain fault. Furthermore, the field is within several kilometers of recently detected seismicity. This, coupled with its active hot springs (~90 degrees C), opaline sinter mounds, and geothermal fluid flow, suggest that the geothermal field lies within an active (Quaternary), southward-terminating, left-stepping fault zone, which locally acts as a pull-apart basin with sinistral- and normal-slip components.\n","created":"03\/23\/2014","email":"jfaulds@unr.edu","fullName":"James E.

Tuscarora is an amagmatic geothermal system that lies in the northern part of the Basin and Range province, ~15 km southeast of the Snake River Plain and ~90 km northwest of Elko, Nevada. The Tuscarora area is dominated by late Eocene to middle Miocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks, all overlying Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks. A geothermal power plant was constructed in 2011 and currently produces 18 MWe from an ~170 degrees C reservoir in metasedimentary rocks at a depth of ~1430 m. Analysis of drill core reveals that the subsurface geology is dominated to depths of ~700-1000 m by intracaldera deposits of the Eocene Big Cottonwood Canyon caldera, including blocks of basement-derived megabreccia. Furthermore, the Tertiary-Paleozoic nonconformity within the geothermal field has been recognized as the margin of this Eocene caldera. Structural relations combined with geochronologic data from previous studies indicate that Tuscarora has undergone extension since the late Eocene, with significant extension in the late Miocene-Pliocene to early Pleistocene. Kinematic analysis of fault slip data reveal an east-west-trending least principal paleostress direction, which probably reflects an earlier episode of Miocene extension.\n\nTwo distinct structural settings at different scales appear to control the geothermal field. The regional structural setting is a 10-km wide complexly faulted left step or relay ramp in the west-dipping range-bounding Independence-Bull Run Mountains normal fault system. Geothermal activity occurs within the step-over where sets of east- and west-dipping normal faults overlap in a northerly trending accommodation zone. The distribution of hot wells and hydrothermal surface features, including boiling springs, fumaroles, and siliceous sinter, indicate that the geothermal system is restricted to the narrow (< 1 km) axial part of the accommodation zone, where permeability is maintained at depth around complex fault intersections. Shallow up-flow appears to be focused along several closely spaced steeply west-dipping north-northeast-striking normal faults within the axial part of the accommodation zone. These faults are favorably oriented for extension and fluid flow under the present-day northwest-trending regional extension direction indicated by previous studies of GPS geodetic data, earthquake focal mechanisms, and kinematic data from late Quaternary faults.\n\nThe recognition of the axial part of an accommodation zone as a favorable structural setting for geothermal activity may be a useful exploration tool for development of drilling targets in extensional terranes, as well as for developing geologic models of known geothermal fields. Preliminary analysis of broad step-overs similar to Tuscarora reveals that geothermal activity occurs in a variety of subsidiary structural settings within these regions. In addition, the presence of several high-temperature systems in northeastern Nevada demonstrates the viability of electrical-grade geothermal activity in this region despite low present-day strain rates as indicated by GPS geodetic data. Geothermal exploration potential in northeastern Nevada may therefore be higher than previously recognized.\n","created":"03\/23\/2014","email":"jfaulds@unr.edu","fullName":"James E.

A system of NW-striking dextral faults known as the Walker Lane accommodates ~20% of the North American-Pacific plate motion in the western Great Basin and is intimately linked to N- to NNE-striking normal fault systems throughout the region. Overall, geothermal systems are concentrated in areas with the highest strain rates within or proximal to the eastern and western margins of the Great Basin, with the highest temperature systems clustering in transtensional areas of highest strain rate in the northwestern Great Basin.\n\nOf the 250+ geothermal fields catalogued, step-overs or relay ramps in normal fault zones serve as the most favorable setting, hosting ~32% of the systems. Such areas have multiple, overlapping fault strands, increased fracture density, and thus enhanced permeability. Other common settings include a) intersections between normal faults and strike-slip or oblique-slip faults (22%), where multiple minor faults connect major structures and fluids can flow readily through highly fractured, dilational quadrants, and b) normal fault terminations or tip-lines (22%), where horse-tailing generates closely-spaced faults and increased permeability. Other settings include accommodation zones (i.e., belts of intermeshing, oppositely dipping normal faults; 8%), major normal faults (6%), displacement transfer zones (5%), and pull-aparts in strike-slip faults (4%). In addition, Quaternary faults lie within or near most systems (e.g., Bell and Ramelli, 2007). The relative scarcity of geothermal systems along displacement-maxima of major normal faults may be due to reduced permeability in thick zones of clay gouge and periodic release of stress in major earthquakes. Step-overs, terminations, intersections, and accommodation zones correspond to long-term, critically stressed areas, where fluid pathways are more likely to remain open in networks of closely-spaced, breccia-dominated fractures.","created":"03\/23\/2014","email":"jfaulds@unr.edu","fullName":"James E.

Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.\n\nStress Magnitudes and directions\nStress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin\/shmax = .527 and shmin\/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). \n\nSlip and dilation tendency for the Tuscarora geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped Tuscarora area (Dering, 2013). The Tuscarora area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the Tuscarora area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations, as explained above. Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60 degrees dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Tuscarora is defined by a left-step in a major north- to-north northeast striking, west-dipping range-bounding normal fault system. Faults within the broad step define an anticlinal accommodation zone wherein east-dipping faults mainly occupy western half of the accommodation zone and west-dipping faults lie in the eastern half of the accommodation zone. The geothermal system resides in the axial part of the accommodation, straddling the two fault dip domains. Within the axial part of the accommodation zone several west-dipping, north northeast-striking faults are well oriented for both slip and dilation, including fault strands that are exploited for both production and injection for the Tuscarora geothermal power plant.\n\nNOTE: 'o' is used in this description to represent lowercase sigma.\n","hasConsent":"1","projectNumber":"EE0002748","phone":"775.682.8751","publicationDate":{"sec":1388473200,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","Tuscarora Geothermal Area","Slip Tendency Analysis","Dilation Tendency Analysis","Slip tendency","dilation tendency","Tuscarora","faulting","faults","fluid flow conduits","stress","ambient stress","shapefile","shape file","GIS","ArcGIS"],"fullName":"James E.

For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin\/shmax = .527 and shmin\/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). \n\nSlip and dilation tendency for the San Emidio geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped Tuscarora area (Rhodes, 2011). The San Emidio area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the San Emidio area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations, as explained above. This is consistent with the shmin determined through inversion of fault data by Rhodes (2011). Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60 degrees dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Interesting, the San Emidio geothermal field lies in an area of primarily north striking faults, which have moderate dilation tendency and moderate to low slip tendency.\n\nNOTE: 'o' is used in this description to represent lowercase sigma.\n","hasConsent":"1","projectNumber":"EE0002748","phone":"775.682.8751","publicationDate":{"sec":1388473200,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","San Emidio Geothermal Area","Slip Tendency Analysis","Dilation Tendency Analysis","San Emidio","faulting","faults","stress","fluid flow conduits","ambient stress","shapefile","shape file","GIS","ArcGIS","slip tendency","dilation tendency"],"fullName":"James E.

Patua lies near the margin between the Basin and Range province, which is characterized by west-northwest directed extension and the Walker Lane province, characterized by west-northwest directed dextral shear. As such, the Patua area likely has been affected by tectonic stress associated with either or both of stress regimes over geologic time. In order to characterize this stress variation we calculated slip tendency at Patua for both normal faulting and strike slip faulting stress regimes. Based on examination of regional and local stress data (as explained above) we applied at shmin direction of 105 to Patua. Whether the vertical stress (sv) magnitude is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) a normal faulting stress regime or the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) magnitude is larger than the vertical stress (sv), a strike-slip faulting stress regime, has very little effect on the dilation tendency, which is controlled by the stresses acting normal to fault planes. As such the dilation tendency results for a strike-slip faulting stress regime and for a normal faulting stress regime are virtually identical, so we present one result for dilation tendency applicable to both strike-slip and normal faulting stress conditions along with slip tendency for both a normal faulting and a strike-slip faulting stress regime. Under these stress conditions, north-northeast striking steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency. Under the strike-slip faulting stress regime, north-northwest and east-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault have the highest slip tendency, while under normal faulting conditions north northeast striking, 60 degrees dipping faults have the highest slip tendency.\n\nNOTE: 'o' is used in this description to represent lowercase sigma.\n","hasConsent":"1","projectNumber":"EE0002748","phone":"775.682.8751","publicationDate":{"sec":1388473200,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","Patua Geothermal Area","Slip Tendency Analysis","Dilation Tendency Analysis","Patua","faulting","faults","stress","fluid dlow conduits","ambient stress","shapefile","shape file","GIS","ArcGIS"],"fullName":"James E.

Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60 degrees dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. The McGinness Hills geothermal system is characterized by a left-step in a north-northeast striking west-dipping fault system within a north northeast striking accommodation zone. As such, the normal faults that define these two structures are well oriented for both slip and dilation, including the west dipping faults that are exploited for both production and injection.

The step over is defined by the Independence Mountains fault zone and the Bull Runs Mountains fault zone which overlap along strike. Strain is transferred between these major fault segments via and array of northerly striking normal faults with offsets of 10s to 100s of meters and strike lengths of less than 5 km. These faults within the step over are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the range-bounding fault zones between which they reside. Faults within the broad step define an anticlinal accommodation zone wherein east-dipping faults mainly occupy western half of the accommodation zone and west-dipping faults lie in the eastern half of the accommodation zone. The 3D model of Tuscarora encompasses 70 small-offset normal faults that define the accommodation zone and a portion of the Independence Mountains fault zone, which dips beneath the geothermal field.  The geothermal system resides in the axial part of the accommodation, straddling the two fault dip domains. The Tuscarora 3D geologic model consists of 10 stratigraphic units. Unconsolidated Quaternary alluvium has eroded down into bedrock units, the youngest and stratigraphically highest bedrock units are middle Miocene rhyolite and dacite flows regionally correlated with the Jarbidge Rhyolite and modeled with uniform cumulative thickness of ~350 m. Underlying these lava flows are Eocene volcanic rocks of the Big Cottonwood Canyon caldera. These units are modeled as intracaldera deposits, including domes, flows, and thick ash deposits that change in thickness and locally pinch out. The Paleozoic basement of consists metasedimenary and metavolcanic rocks, dominated by argillite, siltstone, limestone, quartzite, and metabasalt of the Schoonover and Snow Canyon Formations. Paleozoic formations are lumped in a single basement unit in the model. Fault blocks in the eastern portion of the model are tilted 5-30 degrees toward the Independence Mountains fault zone. Fault blocks in the western portion of the model are tilted toward steeply east-dipping normal faults. These opposing fault block dips define a shallow extensional anticline. Geothermal production is from 4 closely-spaced wells, that exploit a west-dipping, NNE-striking fault zone near the axial part of the accommodation zone.","hasConsent":"1","projectNumber":"EE0002748","phone":"775.682.8751","publicationDate":{"sec":1388473200,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","3D Model","Tuscarora Geothermal Area","faulting","faults","stratigraphy","stratigraphic units","cross-section","cross section","geology","geologic units","geologic contact","tuscarora"],"fullName":"James E.

The Carson Sink is a large composite basin containing three known, blind high-temperature geothermal systems (Fallon Airbase, Stillwater, and Soda Lake). This area was chosen for a detailed gravity survey in order to characterize the gravity signature of the known geothermal systems and to identify other potential blind systems based on the structural setting indicated by the gravity data.\n\nData were acquired at approximately 400, 800, and 1600 meter intervals for a total of 1,243 stations. The project location and station location points are presented in Figure 14. The station distribution for this survey was designed to complete regional gravity coverage in the Carson Sink area without duplication of available public and private gravity coverage. Gravity data were acquired using a Scintrex CG-5 gravimeter and a LaCoste and Romberg (L&R) Model-G gravimeter. The CG-5 gravity meter has a reading resolution of 0.001 milligals and a typical repeatability of less than 0.005 milligals. The L&R gravity meter has a reading resolution of 0.01 milligals and a typical repeatability of 0.02 milligals. The basic processing of gravimeter readings to calculate through to the Complete Bouguer Anomaly was made using the Gravity and Terrain Correction software version 7.1 for Oasis Montaj by Geosoft LTD.\n\nThe gravity survey of the Carson Sink yielded a project location and station location map, a Complete Bouguer Anomaly @ 2.67 gm\/cc reduction density, a Gravity Complete Bouguer Anomaly at 2.50 g\/cc Contour Map, a Gravity Horizontal Gradient Magnitude Shaded Color Contour Map, a Gravity 1st Vertical Derivative Color Contour Map, and an Interpreted Depth to Mesozoic Basement incorporating drill-hole intercept values.\n\nA preliminary interpretation of these results suggests that the Carson Sink is a complex composite basin with several major depocenters. Major depocenters are present in the south-central, east-central, and northeastern parts of the basin. The distribution of gravity anomalies suggests a complex pattern of faulting in the subsurface of the basin, with many fault terminations, step-overs, and accommodation zones. The pattern of faulting implies that other, previously undiscovered blind geothermal systems are likely in the Carson Sink. The gravity survey was completed near the end of this project. Thus, more thorough analysis of the data and potential locations of blind geothermal systems is planned for future work. \n","hasConsent":"1","projectNumber":"EE0002748","phone":"775.682.8751","publicationDate":{"sec":1388473200,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","Carson Sink","Basin and Range","gravity study","gravity model","depth to basement","Nevada","Great Basin","Depth to Basment","Fallon Airbase","Stillwater","Soda Lake","gravity survey","geophysics","complete bouger anomaly","bouger anomaly"],"fullName":"James E.

Major field excursions, incorporating visits to large groups of systems, were conducted in western Nevada, central Nevada, northwestern Nevada, northeastern Nevada, east-central Nevada, eastern California, southern Oregon, and western Utah. For example, field excursions to the following areas included visits of multiple geothermal systems:\n\n- Northwestern Nevada: Baltazor Hot Spring, Blue Mountain, Bog Hot Spring, Dyke Hot Springs, Howard Hot Spring, MacFarlane Hot Spring, McGee Mountain, and Pinto Hot Springs in northwest Nevada.\n- North-central to northeastern Nevada: Beowawe, Crescent Valley (Hot Springs Point), Dann Ranch (Hand-me-Down Hot Springs), Golconda, and Pumpernickel Valley (Tipton Hot Springs) in north-central to northeast Nevada.\n- Eastern Nevada: Ash Springs, Chimney Hot Spring, Duckwater, Hiko Hot Spring, Hot Creek Butte, Iverson Spring, Moon River Hot Spring, Moorman Spring, Railroad Valley, and Williams Hot Spring in eastern Nevada.\n- Southwestern Nevada-eastern California: Walley's Hot Spring, Antelope Valley, Fales Hot Springs, Buckeye Hot Springs, Travertine Hot Springs, Teels Marsh, Rhodes Marsh, Columbus Marsh, Alum-Silver Peak, Fish Lake Valley, Gabbs Valley, Wild Rose, Rawhide-Wedell Hot Springs, Alkali Hot Springs, and Baileys\/Hicks\/Burrell Hot Springs.\n- Southern Oregon: Alvord Hot Spring, Antelope Hot Spring-Hart Mountain, Borax Lake, Crump Geyser, and Mickey Hot Spring in southern Oregon.\n- Western Utah: Newcastle, Veyo Hot Spring, Dixie Hot Spring, Thermo, Roosevelt, Cove Fort, Red Hill Hot Spring, Joseph Hot Spring, Hatton Hot Spring, and Abraham-Baker Hot Springs.\n\nStructural controls of 426 geothermal systems were analyzed with literature research, air photos, Google Earth imagery, and\/or field reviews (Figures 1 and 2). Of the systems analyzed, we were able to determine the structural settings of more than 240 sites. However, we found that many \"systems\" consisted of little more than a warm or hot well in the central part of a basin. Such \"systems\" were difficult to evaluate in terms of structural setting in areas lacking in geophysical data.\n\nDeveloped database for structural catalogue in a master spreadsheet. Data components include structural setting, primary fault orientation, presence or absence of Quaternary faulting, reservoir lithology, geothermometry, presence or absence of recent magmatism, and distinguishing blind systems from those that have surface expressions.\n\nReviewed site locations for all 426 geothermal systems confirmed and\/or relocated spring and geothermal sites based on imagery, maps, and other information for master database. Many systems were mislocated in the original database. In addition, some systems that included several separate springs spread over large areas were divided into two or more distinct systems. Further, all hot wells were assigned names based on their location to facilitate subsequent analyses.\n\nWe catalogued systems into the following eight major groups, based on the dominant pattern of faulting (Figure 1):\n- Major normal fault segments (i.e., near displacement maxima).\n- Fault bends.\n- Fault terminations or tips.\n- Step-overs or relay ramps in normal faults.\n- Fault intersections.\n- Accommodation zones (i.e., belts of intermeshing oppositely dipping normal faults),\n- Displacement transfer zones whereby strike-slip faults terminate in arrays of normal faults.\n- Transtensional pull-aparts.\n\nThese settings form a hierarchal pattern with respect to fault complexity.\n- Major normal faults and fault bends are the simplest.\n- Fault terminations are typically more complex than mid-segments, as faults commonly break up into multiple strands or horsetail near their ends.\n- A fault intersection is generally more complex, as it generally contains both multiple fault strands and can include discrete dilational quadrants.\n- A step-over consists of two overlapping fault terminations and thus involves additional complexity, especially where the relay ramp is breached by multiple fault splays between the main overlapping faults and thus contains multiple fault intersections.\n- Accommodation zones involve further complexity, as they contain multiple fault terminations and fault intersections.\n\nOf the 426 fields analyzed, major findings include (Figures 1 and 2):\n- 39% of the known systems are blind or hidden (Figure 1), with no surface hot springs or fumaroles.\n- The structural setting for ~25% of the systems could not be determined (Figure 2). In most cases, undetermined systems reside in the central part of a basin (commonly warm wells) that lacks adequate geophysical data for elucidating the subsurface structure.\n- Step-overs or relay ramps in normal faults are the most favorable setting (Figure 2), hosting ~32% of the systems analyzed. Such areas are characterized by multiple, commonly overlapping fault strands, increased fracture density, and thus enhanced permeability.\n- Normal fault terminations host 25%.\n- Intersections of normal faults and strike-slip or oblique-slip faults host 22%.\n- Accommodation zones (belts of intermeshing oppositely dipping normal faults) host 9%.\n- Displacement transfer zones host 5%.\n- Pull-aparts in strike-slip faults host 3%.\n- Bends in major normal faults host 2%.\n- Major range-front faults host 1% of the known systems.\nSome of the more robust systems contain more than one type of structural setting. These include Steamboat, Coso, and Dixie Valley. About 21% of the fields are hybrid or compound systems.\n\nPull-aparts and displacement transfer zones are more abundant in the transtensional western part of the Great Basin.\n\nAn analysis of the relations between Quaternary faulting and geothermal systems was completed for the Great Basin region. The 426 localities were overlain on USGS Quaternary fault database in Google Earth to evaluate proximity to mapped faults and look for unrecognized faults.\n- Quaternary faults typically lie within or near most of the geothermal systems.\n- Geothermal fields were evaluated with proximity to Quaternary faults classified in 4 categories: <1 km, 1-2 km, 1-5 km, 1-10 km.\n- Fault ages were classified as historical, Holocene, late Pleistocene, mid-Pleistocene, and Quaternary undivided.\n- The highest percentage of high-temp sites are within 2 km of Quaternary faults.

This overview permitted selection of 5-6 representative sites for more detailed studies in Years 2 and 3. Sites were selected on the basis of quality of exposure, potential for development, availability of subsurface data, and type of\nsystem, so that major types of systems can be evaluated and compared. The detailed investigations included geologic mapping, kinematic analysis, stress determinations, gravity surveys, integration of available geophysical data, slip tendency analysis, and for some areas 3D modeling. In Year 3, the detailed studies were completed and data synthesized to a) compare structural controls in various tectonic settings, b) complete the structural catalogue, and c) apply knowledge to exploration strategies and selection of drilling sites.","created":"03\/19\/2014","email":"jfaulds@unr.edu","fullName":"James E.

As dip is unknown for many faults in the USGS Quaternary Fault Database, we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum slip and dilation tendency.\n- The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.\n\nStress Magnitudes and directions were calculated across the entire Great Basin. Stress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005).\n\nThe minimum horizontal stress direction (Shmin) was contoured, and spatial bins with common Shmin directions were calculated. Based on this technique, we subdivided the Great Basin into nine regions (Shmin <070, 070<Shmin<080, 080<Shmin<090, 090<Shmin<100, 100<Shmin<110, 110<Shmin<120, 120<Shmin<130, 130<Shmin<140, Shmin>140). Slip and dilation tendency were calculated using 3DStress for the faults within each region using the mean Shmin for the region. Shmin variation throughout Great Basin are shown on Figure 3.\n\nFor faults within the Great Basin proper, we applied a normal faulting stress regime, where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax), which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin). Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin, we used magnitudes such that shmin\/shmax = .527 and shmin\/sv= .46. These values are consistent with stress magnitude data at both Dixie Valley (Hickman et al., 2000) and Yucca Mountain (Stock et al., 1985).\n\nFor faults within the Walker Lane\/Eastern California Shear Zone, we applied a strike-slip faulting stress, where shmax > sv > shmin. Upon visual inspection of limited stress magnitude data from the Walker Lane and Eastern California Shear zone, we chose values such that SHmin\/SHmax = .46 and Shmin\/Sv= .527 representative of the region. \n\nResults: The results of our slip and dilation tendency analysis are shown in Figures 4 (dilation tendency), 5 (slip tendency) and 6 (slip tendency + dilation tendency). Shmin varies from northwest to east-west trending throughout much of the Great Basin. As such, north- to northeast-striking faults have the highest tendency to slip and to dilate, depending on the local trend of shmin. These results provide a first order filter on faults and fault systems in the Great Basin, affording focusing of local-scale exploration efforts for blind or hidden geothermal resources.\n","hasConsent":"1","projectNumber":"EE0002748","phone":"775.682.8751","publicationDate":{"sec":1380520800,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","Slip Tendency","Dilation Tendency","Stress Fields","Quaternary Faults","Great Basin","Walker Lane","Basin and Range","faults","fault systems","hidden geothermal systems","structural controls","EGS","conventional","exploration"],"fullName":"James E.

Local geology\n2. Thermal features\n3. Known boreholes and temperature gradients\n4. Geophysical surveys\n5. Fluid geochemistry and geothermometry\n6. Estimate of the heat-in-place\n\nDescription of the heat-in-place estimate:\nThe magnitude of the geothermal resource at McGee Mountain (Painted Hills) has been estimated using a Monte Carlo method applied to estimating heat-in-place. The method relies (along with certain other parameters) on estimates of the area, thickness and average temperature of the resource, but among these, only area has some constraint at this time. Therefore, the estimates used for thickness and temperature have been based on the characteristics of other\ngeothermal resources in Nevada.\n\nResults yield a 90%-probable (\"P90\") thermal energy-in-place estimate of 87,300 MWth-years (that is, 90% of estimates are higher). We consider this to be a minimum likely value. At 50% probability (\"P50\") the estimate is 134,000 MWth-years. The recoverable portion of the preceding estimate of energy-in-place has also been estimated and converted into electrical energy, using values of recovery factor, rejection temperature, utilization factor, plant capacity factor and power plant life that are provided. The minimum (90% probable) estimate for generation potential is about 25 MWe for 30 years (or a total of 750 MWe-years) and at 50% probability the estimate is 52 MWe for 30 years (or a total of 1,560 MWe-years). These estimates are somewhat larger than a public-domain McGee resource estimate made by GeothermEx in 2004, because a 2-m deep temperature survey by Caldera has established continuance of the thermal anomaly about a half mile further north than previously documented.\n\nThis resource estimate was made without reference to the Caldera property (project area) boundary, but it is likely that the entire magnitude of estimated resource lies within it. The estimate should be regarded with caution because there needs to be subsequent proof of area, thickness, temperature and commercial permeability by means of deep drilling and testing. No heat-in-place estimate of this type should ever be used to determine the final, installed size of a well field and power plant.\n","created":"03\/07\/2014","email":"zehnerrick@yahoo.com","fullName":"Richard Zehner","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","Nevada","McGee Mountain","Geology","Geochemistry","Monte Carlo","Heat in place estimate","Report","thermal features","borehole gradient","temperature gradient","geophysics","geophysical survey","borehole","bore hole","geothermometry","fluid","heat-in-place"],"phone":"775.338.5593","projectNumber":"EE0002830","publicationDate":{"sec":1277964000,"usec":0},"publisher":"Geothermal Technical Partners, Inc.","resources":[{"name":"Independent Technical Report.pdf","size":2764712,"desc":"Report detailing exploration, drilling and sampling, adjacent properties, resource estimates, other relevant information, interpretations, and conclusions.","tier":1,"actualName":"Caldera USA NV McGee Mtn IR 100701 GEx (1).pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1277964000,"usec":0},"coordinates":[41.802842814507,-118.85859561768],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[41.839799510733,-118.80749111328],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[41.76588611828,-118.90970012207]}}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"Geothermal Resource at the McGee Mountain Prospect, Humboldt County, Nevada","updated":[{"sec":1394209031,"usec":0},{"sec":1395847833,"usec":0},{"sec":1496679988,"usec":0},{"sec":1496680533,"usec":0},{"sec":1496680575,"usec":0}],"userId":3844,"projectLead":"Mark Ziegenbein","xdrId":345,"submitted":{"sec":1394209031,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Recovery Act: Effectiveness of shallow temperature surveys to target a geothermal reservoir at previously explored site at McGee Mountain, Nevada","hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"5318cfe6627688c71b000000"},"abstract":"The McGee Mountain geothermal area was selected  to test early-stage shallow temperature survey techniques and drill two slim holes to test the resource. Geothermal Technical Partners, Inc. was able to complete only a small portion of the project before lack of funding prevented further exploration work. This work included a shallow (2-meter) temperature survey, a Geoprobe survey, a close-spaced gravity survey, and several reports on geologic and transmission viability.\n\nThe 18-page report includes a description of the geothermal geology of the area, geochemistry and geothermometry of nearby springs and wells, and findings from the shallow temperature survey, Geoprobe survey, close-spaced gravity survey, heat-in-place estimate, transmission viability, and an archeological survey. The report makes the following conclusions:\n\nBoth the shallow 2-meter and the Geoprobe surveys are cost-effective methods to detect subsurface thermal anomalies in early-stage exploration, prior to more expensive temperature gradient drilling.\nThe major advantages of the 2-meter survey are its extreme portability (no roads needed), cost per site measurement, and low environmental impact.\nThe 2-meter survey's disadvantages are its inability to penetrate hard substrates and the noise effects due to solar heating of the ground.\nThe Geoprobe's advantages are its ability to collect temperature and uncontaminated water samples, greater depth of penetration (to 60m), relatively low cost, and low environmental impact.\nThe Geoprobe's disadvantages are its inability to go off-road or to penetrate hard substrates.\nCosts to perform both types of surveys are low, together less than the cost of one conventional temperature gradient well. Given the potential increase in data that these surveys can provide, this is extreme value for the exploration dollar.\n","created":"03\/06\/2014","email":"zehnerrick@yahoo.com","fullName":"Richard Zehner","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","Nevada","McGee Mountain","Shallow temperature survey","Geoprobe","Geochemistry","Geology","Transmission","Report","gravity","survey","feasibility","archaeological clearance","geothermometry","cost-effective","thermal anomalies","cost"],"phone":"775.338.5593","projectNumber":"EE0002830","publicationDate":{"sec":1394175600,"usec":0},"publisher":"Geothermal Technical Partners, Inc.","resources":[{"name":"Final Report.pdf","size":2336777,"desc":"Report detailing geology, geochemistry, shallow temperature survey, Geoprobe survey, gravity survey, transmission feasibility, archaeological clearance survey, and conclusions.","tier":1,"actualName":"GTPMcGeeFinalReportEE0002830.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1394089200,"usec":0},"coordinates":[41.826116863688,-119.0766055664],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[41.878921861661,-119.02172451172],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[41.773311865716,-119.13148662109]}}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"Effectiveness of Shallow Temperature Surveys to Target a Geothermal Reservoir at Previously Explored Site at McGee Mountain, Nevada: Final Report for U.S. Department Of Energy Grant EE-0002830","updated":[{"sec":1394135014,"usec":0},{"sec":1395847776,"usec":0},{"sec":1496678974,"usec":0},{"sec":1496679530,"usec":0},{"sec":1496679577,"usec":0}],"userId":3844,"projectLead":"Mark Ziegenbein","xdrId":344,"submitted":{"sec":1394135014,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Recovery Act:  Effectiveness of shallow temperature surveys to target a geothermal reservoir at previously explored site at McGee Mountain, Nevada","authors":[{"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Zehner","affiliation":"Geothermal Technical Partners Inc."}],"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"53165b136276885246000001"},"status":"Publicly accessible","publisher":"Flint Geothermal, LLC","updated":[{"sec":1393974035,"usec":0},{"sec":1393974110,"usec":0},{"sec":1393974156,"usec":0},{"sec":1396971029,"usec":0},{"sec":1401902985,"usec":0},{"sec":1407170953,"usec":0},{"sec":1496678749,"usec":0}],"submissionName":"Penrose Well Temperatures","created":"03\/04\/2014","userId":3844,"abstract":"Penrose Well Temperatures\n\nGeothermal waters have been encountered in several wells near Penrose in Fremont County, Colorado.

Partly from these anomalies, and partly through other evidence layers, CIRES came up with 'polygons' representing areas prospective for geothermal development. Many of the anomalies are much larger and of different shapes than typical geothermal outflow zones, and many occur on ridgetops or other places geothermal systems typically do not form. This might indicate that the thermal anomalies are mostly solar (not geothermal) in nature.\n\nThe purpose of this analysis is to construct some spatial statistics to help understand the viability of the CIRES target model. In this model, ground thermal anomalies in Colorado are detected using either ASTER or LANDSAT thermal infrared spectral bands (among others). Those areas above some anomaly threshold (1 and 2 standard deviations) were then designated as \"anomalous.\" One way to test the viability of their model would be to examine the area spatial statistics make use of the relative area of anomaly versus the total area, and the relative proportion of overlap between ASTER and LANDSAT data. If the area considered to be anomalous is large compared to the total area, then the infrared imagery would be a \"blunt tool\" for finding geothermal systems: the search is confined to too large an area. If there is disagreement between the areas found to be anomalous by ASTER and the areas found to be anomalous by LANDSAT, then the technique might not be robust. \n\nTo do this, ESRI Spatial Analyst was used to convert all of the anomaly shapefiles into ESRI grids with a 100m cell size.

It was made in order to identify possible fault and fracture systems that might be conduits for geothermal fluids, as part of a DOE reconnaissance geothermal exploration program.\n\nGeothermal fluids commonly utilize fault and fractures in competent rocks as conduits for fluid flow. Geothermal exploration involves finding areas of high near-surface temperature gradients, along with a suitable \"plumbing system\" that can provide the necessary permeability. Geothermal power plants can sometimes be built where temperature and flow rates are high.\n\nThis line shapefile is an attempt to use desktop GIS to delineate possible faults and fracture orientations and locations in highly prospective areas prior to an initial site visit. Geochemical sampling and geologic mapping could then be centered around these possible faults and fractures.\n\nTo do this, georeferenced topographic maps and aerial photographs were utilized in an existing GIS, using ESRI ArcMap 10.0 software. The USA_Topo_Maps and World_Imagery  map layers were chosen from the GIS Server at  server.arcgisonline.com, using a UTM Zone 13 NAD27 projection. This line shapefile was then constructed over that which appeared to be through-going structural lineaments in both the aerial photographs and topographic layers, taking care to avoid manmade features such as roads, fence lines, and utility right-of-ways.  Still, it is unknown what actual features these lineaments, if they exist, represent.\n\nAlthough the shapefiles are arranged by county, not all areas within any county have been examined for lineaments. Work was focused on either satellite thermal infrared anomalies, known hot springs or wells, or other evidence of geothermal systems. Finally, lineaments may be displaced somewhat from their actual location, due to such factors as shadow effects with low sun angles in the aerial photographs.\n\nCredits:\nThese lineament shapefile was created by Geothermal Development Associates, as part of a geothermal geologic reconnaissance performed by Flint Geothermal, LLC, of Denver Colorado.\n\nUse Limitation:\nThese shapefiles were constructed as an aid to geothermal exploration in preparation for a site visit for field checking. We make no claims as to the existence of the lineaments, their location, orientation, and\/or nature. \n","hasConsent":"1","projectNumber":"EE0002828","phone":"775.737.7806","publicationDate":{"sec":1328079600,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","Structure","Lineaments","Air-Photos","Colorado","Alamosa County","Archeluta County","Chaffee County","Delta County","Dolores County","Eagle County","Garfield County","Mineral County","Park County","Routt County","San Miguel County","shapefile","shape file","exploration","GIS","ArcGIS","geospatial"],"fullName":"Richard Zehner","email":"rzehner@gdareno.com","resources":[{"name":"Alamosa Lineaments.zip","size":25435,"desc":"Extent: \nWest  -106.854735    East  -105.434332 \nNorth  38.569260    South  36.997859 \nProjection Information: UTM Zone 13 NAD 27 projection\n","tier":1,"actualName":"AlamosaLineaments.zip","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"submembers":6,"type":"archive","sampleDate":{"sec":1328079600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[37.7835595,-106.2779325],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[38.56926,-105.434332],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[36.997859,-107.121533]}},{"name":"Archuleta Lineaments.zip","size":10057,"desc":"Extent: \nWest  -107.121533    East  -106.895549 \nNorth  37.326935    South  37.172140 \nProjection Information: UTM Zone 13 NAD 27 projection","tier":1,"actualName":"ArchuletaLineaments.zip","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"submembers":7,"type":"archive","sampleDate":{"sec":1328079600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[37.2495375,-107.008541],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[37.326935,-106.895549],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[37.17214,-107.121533]}},{"name":"Chaffee Lineaments.zip","size":20403,"desc":"Extent: \nWest  -106.337314    East  -105.985993 \nNorth  39.010980    South  38.479940 \nProjection Information: UTM Zone 13 NAD 27 projection\n","tier":1,"actualName":"ChaffeeLineaments.zip","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"submembers":6,"type":"archive","sampleDate":{"sec":1328079600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[38.74546,-106.1616535],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[39.01098,-105.985993],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[38.47994,-106.337314]}},{"name":"Delta Lineaments.zip","size":38635,"desc":"Projection Information: UTM Zone 13 NAD 27 projection","tier":1,"actualName":"DeltaLineaments.zip","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"submembers":6,"type":"archive","sampleDate":{"sec":1328079600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[38.7793675,-107.8100265],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[39.008181,-107.418925],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[38.550554,-108.201128]}},{"name":"Dolores Lineaments.zip","size":11788,"desc":"Dolores County lineaments.

Geological characteristics such as faulting and other available datasets for known thermally active areas in Colorado were used in conjunction with the satellite thermal imagery to rank potential areas of geothermal activity.","created":"02\/27\/2014","email":"Khalid.Hussein@colorado.edu","fullName":"Khalid Hussein","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","Colorado","CIRES","ASTER","LANDSAT","Remote sensing","Thermal infrared","target areas","geothermal potential","identify","deep resource wells","potential"],"phone":"303.492.6782","projectNumber":"EE0002828","publicationDate":{"sec":1328079600,"usec":0},"publisher":"Flint Geothermal, LLC","resources":[{"name":"Approach Overview.pdf","size":243057,"desc":"This document outlines the approach ans methodology used by CIRES to identify target areas.","tier":1,"actualName":"CIRES_Approach_Overview.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1328079600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[38.953843128855,-105.50574375],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[40.975133433832,-102.0396078125],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[36.932552823879,-108.9718796875]}}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"CIRES Approach Overview to Using Thermal Infrared Imagery to Find Geothermal Systems in Colorado","updated":[{"sec":1393543713,"usec":0},{"sec":1393878815,"usec":0},{"sec":1401902633,"usec":0},{"sec":1496673181,"usec":0},{"sec":1496673792,"usec":0},{"sec":1496673804,"usec":0}],"userId":6555,"projectLead":"Mark Ziegenbein","xdrId":332,"submitted":{"sec":1393543713,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Recovery Act: Use Remote Sensing Data (selected visible and infrared spectrums) to locate high temp ground anomalies in Colorado.Confirm heat flow potential w\/ on-site temp surveys to drill deep resource wells","hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"530fc73b627688885f000002"},"abstract":"The CIRES remote sensing unit of the University of Colorado was commissioned by Flint Geothermal LLC to identify areas of warm ground that could signify the thermal signature of \"blind\" geothermal systems.

Data was obtained for two different dates. The digital numbers of each Landsat scene were converted to radiance and the temperature was calculated in degrees Kelvin and then converted to degrees Celsius for each land cover type using the emissivity of that cover type. And this process was repeated for each of the land cover types (open water, barren, deciduous forest and evergreen forest, mixed forest, shrub\/scrub, grassland\/herbaceous, pasture hay, and cultivated crops). The temperature of each pixel within each scene was calculated using the thermal band.

Detailed descriptions of the 2-meter survey method and equipment design can be found in Coolbaugh et al. (2007) and Sladek et al. (2007), and are summarized here.\n\nThe survey method was devised to measure temperature as far below the zone of solar influence as possible, have minimal equilibration time, and yet be portable enough to fit on the back of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV); Figure 2). This method utilizes a direct push technology (DPT) technique where 2.3 m long, 0.54\" outer diameter hollow steel rods are pounded into the ground using a demolition hammer. Resistance temperature devices (RTD) are then inserted into the rods at 2-meter depths, and allowed to equilibrate for one hour. The temperatures are then measured and recorded, the rods pulled out of the ground, and re-used at future sites. Usually multiple rods are planted over the course of an hour, and then the sampler returns back to the first station, measures the temperatures, pulls the rods, and so on, to eliminate waiting time.\n\nAt Wagon Wheel Gap, 32 rods were planted around the hot springs between June 20 and July 1, 2012. The purpose was to determine the direction of a possible upflow fault or other structure. Temperatures at 1.5m and 2m depths were measured and recorded in the attribute table of this point shapefile. Several anomalous temperatures suggest that outflow is coming from a ~N60W striking fault or shear zone that contains the quartz-fluorite-barite veins of the adjacent patented mining claims.\n\nIt should be noted that temperatures at 2m depth vary according to the amount of solar heating from above, as well as possible geothermal heating from below.\n","hasConsent":"1","projectNumber":"EE0002828","phone":"775.737.7806","publicationDate":{"sec":1328079600,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","shallow temperature surveys","Colorado","Shallow temperature survey","ArcGIS","GIS","shapefile","shape file","geospatial"],"fullName":"Richard E.

According to Joannon (1991), one of the critical parameters that determines the detonability of given gas mixture is the initial pressure, and so the effect of pressure on DDT was examined.","created":"02\/13\/2014","email":"mcgrube@sandia.gov","fullName":"Mark Grubelich","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","combustion","deflagration","detonation","ethylene\/nitrous oxide mixtures","nitrous oxide","hydrocarbon","ethylene","high pressure","stoichiometry","report"],"moratorium":{"releaseDate":{"sec":1496383200,"usec":0}},"phone":"505.844.9052","projectLead":"Greg Stillman","projectNumber":"FY14 AOP 1.3.2.3","publicationDate":{"sec":1383285600,"usec":0},"publisher":"Sandia National Laboratories","resources":[{"name":"Zucrow Testing Report.docx","size":14631101,"desc":"Report detailing the methods, results, and future steps of the work described above.","tier":1,"actualName":"Zucrow Testing Report.docx","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"text_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1383285600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[35.054784795927,-106.54382228851]}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"High-Pressure Combustion and Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition in Ethylene\/Nitrous Oxide Mixtures","updated":[{"sec":1392335449,"usec":0},{"sec":1392838722,"usec":0},{"sec":1392838743,"usec":0},{"sec":1410278233,"usec":0},{"sec":1496414668,"usec":0},{"sec":1496414680,"usec":0}],"userId":6190,"xdrId":294,"submitted":{"sec":1392335449,"usec":0},"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"52fce2e1627688c943000000"},"status":"Publicly accessible","publisher":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","updated":[{"sec":1392304864,"usec":0},{"sec":1392322811,"usec":0},{"sec":1392838608,"usec":0},{"sec":1407178666,"usec":0},{"sec":1495035419,"usec":0},{"sec":1495035425,"usec":0},{"sec":1495035476,"usec":0},{"sec":1495036097,"usec":0},{"sec":1495036215,"usec":0},{"sec":1495036280,"usec":0},{"sec":1496360230,"usec":0},{"sec":1496360678,"usec":0},{"sec":1496360698,"usec":0},{"sec":1496360716,"usec":0},{"sec":1496360820,"usec":0}],"submissionName":"Stimulation at Desert Peak -Modeling with the Coupled THM Code FEHM","created":"02\/13\/2014","userId":6451,"abstract":"Numerical modeling of the 2011 shear stimulation at the Desert Peak Well 27-15 using a coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical simulator.

Project HOTSPOT has coordinated international institutions and organizations to understand subsurface stratigraphy and assess geothermal potential. Over 5.9km of core were drilled from three boreholes within the SRP in an attempt to acquire continuous core documenting the volcanic and sedimentary record of the hotspot: (1) Kimama, (2) Kimberly, and (3) Mountain Home. The Kimama drill site was set up to acquire a continuous record of basaltic volcanism along the central volcanic axis and to test the extent of geothermal resources beneath the Snake River aquifer. This submission includes photos of the core samples taken from the Kimberly drill hole.\nData submitted by project collaborator Doug Schmitt, University of Alberta\n\n*Note - The archive file

Project HOTSPOT has coordinated international institutions and organizations to understand subsurface stratigraphy and assess geothermal potential. Over 5.9km of core were drilled from three boreholes within the SRP in an attempt to acquire continuous core documenting the volcanic and sedimentary record of the hotspot: (1) Kimama, (2) Kimberly, and (3) Mountain Home. The Mountain Home drill hole is located along the western plain and documents older basalts overlain by sediment. This submission includes photos of the core samples taken from the Mountain Home drill hole.\nData submitted by project collaborator Doug Schmitt, University of Alberta\n\n*Note - The archive file

drilling and logging technologies is to promote ways and means to reduce the cost of geothermal drilling through an integrated effort which involves developing an understanding of geothermal drilling and logging needs, elucidating best practices, and fostering an environment and mechanisms to share methods and means to advance the state of the art. Drilling is an essential and expensive part of geothermal exploration, development, and utilization. Drilling, logging, and completing geothermal wells are expensive because of high temperatures and hard, fractured formations. The consequences of reducing cost are often impressive, because drilling and well completion can account for more than half of the capital cost for a geothermal power project.\n\nThe objectives of Advanced Geothermal Drilling and Logging Technologies are:\n1. Quantitatively understand geothermal drilling costs from around the world and identify ways to reduce those costs, while maintaining or enhancing productivity.\n2. Identify and develop new and improved technologies for significantly reducing the cost of geothermal well construction to lower the cost of electricity and\/or heat produced with geothermal resources.\n3. Inform the international geothermal community about these drilling technologies.\n4. Provide a vehicle for international cooperation, field tests, etc. toward the development and demonstration of improved geothermal drilling and logging technologies.\n","created":"02\/06\/2014","email":"dablank@sandia.gov","fullName":"Doug Blankenship","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","IEA","gia","Annex VII","2012","Drilling","Annual Report","logging","techniques"],"projectNumber":"FY14 AOP 1.5.3.1","publicationDate":{"sec":1387090800,"usec":0},"publisher":"Sandia National Laboratories","resources":[{"name":"Report.pdf","size":830223,"desc":"Annual Report for 2012 IEA\/GIA Annex VII titled \"Advanced Geothermal Drilling and Logging Technologies.\"","tier":1,"actualName":"Annex VII Annual 12.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1387090800,"usec":0},"coordinates":[33.578014746144,-106.875]}],"status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"Advanced Geothermal Drilling and Logging Technologies","updated":[{"sec":1391700028,"usec":0},{"sec":1392047229,"usec":0},{"sec":1410278629,"usec":0},{"sec":1496263668,"usec":0}],"userId":3714,"projectLead":"Greg Stillman","xdrId":288,"submitted":{"sec":1391700028,"usec":0},"authors":[{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Raymond","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Knudsen","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Blankenship","affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Bjornstad","affiliation":"USN Geothermal Program Office"},{"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Barbour","affiliation":"Barbour Well Inc"},{"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Schen","affiliation":"NOV Downhole"}],"hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":false,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"52f2c93b6276884106000001"},"abstract":"Dixie Valley production data for January 2014, for a DOE Report.

Idaho, hosts potential geothermal resources due to elevated groundwater temperatures associated with the thermal anomaly Yellowstone-Snake River hotspot. Project HOTSPOT has coordinated international institutions and organizations to understand subsurface stratigraphy and assess geothermal potential. Over 5.9km of core were drilled from three boreholes within the SRP in an attempt to acquire continuous core documenting the volcanic and sedimentary record of the hotspot: (1) Kimama, (2) Kimberly, and (3) Mountain Home. The Mountain Home drill hole is located along the western plain and documents older basalts overlain by sediment. \nData submitted by project collaborator Doug Schmitt, University of Alberta","created":"02\/05\/2014","email":"johnshervais@usu.edu","fullName":"John Shervais","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","Snake River Plain","Project HOTSPOT","Idaho","Yellowstone Hotspot","borehole geophysics","Mountain Home","geophysics","borehole log","dowhnhole geophysics","temperature","pressure","gamma ray","magnetic susceptibility","geochemistry","thorium","uranium","potassium","neutron","resistivity","image log","SRP","borehole","well data"],"phone":"4357971274","projectNumber":"EE0002848","publicationDate":{"sec":1352617200,"usec":0},"publisher":"Utah State University","resources":[{"name":"Image Log Raw Data.txt","size":1124670,"desc":"Data associated with composite log image of borehole geophysics from Mountain Home well, Snake River Plain, Idaho","tier":1,"actualName":"SRSDP_Mountain_Home_Composite.txt","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"text_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1352617200,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":918,"depth":1675,"coordinates":[43,115]},{"name":"Borehole Geophysics Data.las","size":153005509,"desc":"Composite WellCAD file of borehole geophysics (raw data) from Mountain Home well, Snake River Plain, Idaho","tier":2,"actualName":"SRSDP_Mountain_Home_Composite.las","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"data","sampleDate":{"sec":1352617200,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":918,"depth":1675,"coordinates":[43,115]},{"name":"Logging Summary.png","size":17022,"desc":"Summary figure of borehole geophysics from Mountain Home well, Snake River Plain, Idaho","tier":1,"actualName":"SRSDP_Mountain_Home_Logging_Summary.png","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image","sampleDate":{"sec":1352617200,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":918,"depth":1675,"coordinates":[43,115]},{"name":"Image Log.jpg","size":1042527,"desc":"Composite log image of borehole geophysics from Mountain Home well, Snake River Plain, Idaho","tier":1,"actualName":"SRSDP_Mountain_Home_Composite.jpg","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image","sampleDate":{"sec":1352617200,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":918,"depth":1675,"coordinates":[43,115]},{"name":"Resistivity Measurements.csv","size":125357,"desc":"CSV file exported from WellCad of primary and secondary resistivity measurements.","tier":2,"actualName":"Mountain_Home_Elog.csv","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"data","sampleDate":{"sec":1326870000,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":918,"depth":1675,"coordinates":[43,115]},{"name":"BH Televiewer - SRSDPMH103.lis","size":14616744,"desc":"LIS file of borehole televiewer","tier":1,"actualName":"SRSDPMH103.lis","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"other","sampleDate":{"sec":1326956400,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":918,"depth":1675,"coordinates":[43,115]},{"name":"BH Televiewer - SRSDPMH104.lis","size":13739268,"desc":"LIS file of borehole televiewer","tier":1,"actualName":"SRSDPMH104.lis","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"other","sampleDate":{"sec":1326956400,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":918,"depth":1675,"coordinates":[43,115]},{"name":"Mountain_Home_Ftot.csv","size":1697385,"desc":"CSV file exported from WellCad of total magnetic field amplitude.

Project HOTSPOT has coordinated international institutions and organizations to understand subsurface stratigraphy and assess geothermal potential.

The Kimberly drill hole was selected to document continuous volcanism when analysed in conjunction with the Kimama and is located near the margin of the plain.\n\nData submitted by project collaborator Doug Schmitt, University of Alberta","created":"02\/05\/2014","email":"john.shervais@usu.edu","fullName":"John Shervais","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","Project HOTSPOT","Snake River Plain","Yellowstone Hotspot","Idaho","borehole geophysics","Kimberly","temperature","pressure","gamma ray","seismic","sonic","magnetic susceptibility","borehole log","downhole","geophysics","geochemistry","thorium","uranium","neutron","resistivity","potassium","image log","downhole geophysics","SRP","borehole","well data"],"phone":"4357971274","projectNumber":"EE0002848","publicationDate":{"sec":1309759200,"usec":0},"publisher":"Utah State University","resources":[{"name":"Borehole Geophysics Data.las","size":175146753,"desc":"Composite WellCAD file of borehole geophysics (raw data) from Kimberly well, Snake River Plain, Idaho","tier":2,"actualName":"SRSDP_Kimberly_Composite_Log.las","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"data","sampleDate":{"sec":1302156000,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1180,"depth":1900,"coordinates":[42.549830555556,114.34257222222]},{"name":"Image Log Raw Data.txt","size":4978724,"desc":"Data associated with composite log image of borehole geophysics from Kimberly well, Snake River Plain, Idaho","tier":1,"actualName":"SRSDP_Kimberly_Composite.txt","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"text_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1302156000,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1180,"depth":1900,"coordinates":[42.549830555556,114.34257222222]},{"name":"Logging Summary.png","size":18860,"desc":"Summary figure of borehole geophysics from Kimberly well, Snake River Plain, Idaho","tier":1,"actualName":"SRSDP_Kimberly_Logging_Summary.png","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image","sampleDate":{"sec":1302156000,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1180,"depth":1900,"coordinates":[42.549830555556,114.34257222222]},{"name":"Image Log.jpg","size":8053255,"desc":"Composite log image of borehole geophysics from Kimberly well, Snake River Plain, Idaho","tier":1,"actualName":"SRSDP_Kimberly_Composite.jpg","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image","sampleDate":{"sec":1302156000,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1180,"depth":1900,"coordinates":[42.549830555556,114.34257222222]},{"name":"Resistivity Measurements.csv","size":309245,"desc":"CSV file exported from WellCad of primary and secondary resistivity measurements.","tier":2,"actualName":"Kimberly_Elog.csv","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"data","sampleDate":{"sec":1309413600,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Snake River Plain Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1180,"depth":1900,"coordinates":[42.549830555556,114.34257222222]},{"name":"BH Televiewer -

Microseismic mapping is a key tool used to infer the subsurface fracture geometry. Traditional earthquake detection and location techniques are often employed to identify microearthquakes in geothermal regions. However, most commonly used algorithms may miss events if the seismic signal of an earthquake is small relative to the background noise level or if a microearthquake occurs within the coda of a larger event. Consequently, we have developed a set of algorithms that provide improved microearthquake detection. Our objective is to investigate the microseismicity at the DOE Newberry EGS site to better image the active regions of the underground fracture network during and immediately after the EGS stimulation. Detection of more microearthquakes during EGS stimulations will allow for better seismic delineation of the active regions of the underground fracture system. This improved knowledge of the reservoir network will improve our understanding of subsurface conditions, and allow improvement of the stimulation strategy that will optimize heat extraction and maximize economic return.","created":"02\/04\/2014","email":"templeton4@llnl.gov","fullName":"Dennise Templeton","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","EGS","seismicity","microseismicity","stimulation","fracture","reservoir","NGDS Content Model","USGIN Content Model","induced seismicity","Newberry","microearthquake","monitoring","measurement","detection","hydrualic"],"phone":"9254222021","projectNumber":"FY13 AOP 25728","publicationDate":{"sec":1383285600,"usec":0},"publisher":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","resources":[{"name":"Newberry Earthquake Catalog.xls","size":219648,"desc":"Earthquake catalog of events occurring between October 2012 - March 2013.

The overall project area is 2500km2 with the Calibration Area (Dixie Valley Geothermal Wellfield) being about 170km2. \n\nThe Final Scientific Report (FSR) is submitted in two parts (I and II).\n\nFSR part I presents (1) an assessment of the readily available public domain data and some proprietary data provided by terra-gen power, llc, (2) a re-interpretation of these data as required, (3) an exploratory geostatistical data analysis, (4) the baseline geothermal conceptual model, and (5) the EGS favorability\/trust mapping.  The conceptual model presented applies to both the hydrothermal system and EGS in the Dixie Valley region. \n\nFSR Part II presents (1) 278 new gravity stations; (2) enhanced gravity-magnetic modeling; (3) 42 new ambient seismic noise survey stations; (4) an integration of the new seismic noise data with a regional seismic network; (5) a new methodology and approach to interpret this data; (5) a novel method to predict rock type and temperature based on the newly interpreted data; (6) 70 new magnetotelluric (MT) stations; (7) an integrated interpretation of the enhanced MT data set; (8) the results of a 308 station soil CO2 gas survey; (9) new conductive thermal modeling in the project area; (10) new convective modeling in the Calibration Area; (11) pseudo-convective modeling in the Calibration Area; (12) enhanced data implications and qualitative geoscience correlations at three scales (a) Regional, (b) Project, and (c) Calibration Area; (13) quantitative geostatistical exploratory data analysis; and (14) responses to nine questions posed in the proposal for this investigation.  \n\nEnhanced favorability\/trust maps were not generated because there was not a sufficient amount of new, fully-vetted (see below) rock type, temperature, and stress data. The enhanced seismic data did generate a new method to infer rock type and temperature (However, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator for this project, this new methodology needs to be tested and evaluated at other sites in the Basin and Range before it is used to generate the referenced maps. As in the baseline conceptual model, the enhanced findings can be applied to both the hydrothermal system and EGS in the Dixie Valley region).\n","fullName":"Joe Iovenitti","email":"jiovenitti@altarockenergy.com","phone":"510.290.9247","publisher":"AltaRock Energy Inc","publicationDate":{"sec":1388646000,"usec":0},"hasConsent":"1","resources":[{"name":"Part I Final Scientific Report.pdf","desc":"Baseline Conceptual Model of the EGS Exploration Methodology Project (using the Dixie Valley Geothermal System, Nevada as a Calibration Site).","tier":1,"actualName":"Part I_Final Scientific Report_final complete.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1388646000,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Dixie Valley Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1028,"depth":6000,"coordinates":[39.935,-117.9],"size":70430704},{"name":"Part II Final Scientific Report.pdf","desc":"Enhanced Conceptual Model of the EGS Exploration Methodology Project (using the Dixie Valley Geothermal System, Nevada as a Calibration Site).","tier":1,"actualName":"Part II_Final Scientific Report_final complete.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1388646000,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Dixie Valley Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1028,"depth":6000,"coordinates":[39.935,-117.9],"size":125106311},{"name":"Gravity Stations and Data.xlsx","desc":"Location of gravity stations and complete Bouguer anomaly calculatd at 2.67 gm\/cc","tier":2,"actualName":"gravity-dvnew-final.xlsx","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"data","sampleDate":{"sec":1386313200,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Dixie Valley Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1028,"depth":6000,"coordinates":[39.935,-117.9],"size":28810},{"name":"Magnetotelluric Metadata.doc","desc":"Description of magnetotelluric data acquisition and processing methods","tier":1,"actualName":"MT-README-WBdix.doc","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"text_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1384239600,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Dixie Valley Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1028,"depth":6000,"coordinates":[39.935,-117.9],"size":25088},{"name":"Magnetotelluric station locations.txt","desc":"Magnetotelluric station locations","tier":1,"actualName":"MT-stations-AD-utm94.txt","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"text_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1331532000,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Dixie Valley Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1028,"depth":6000,"coordinates":[39.935,-117.9],"size":3048},{"name":"Magnetotelluric Data.txt","desc":"Magnetotelluric data aquired and used for inversion","tier":1,"actualName":"MT-data-aldx9440.txt","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"data","sampleDate":{"sec":1331618400,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Dixie Valley Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1028,"depth":6000,"coordinates":[39.935,-117.9],"size":844692},{"name":"Magnetotelluric Inversion Data.txt","desc":"Magnetotelluric Inversion Data","tier":1,"actualName":"MT-data-DV_121114_mod54.txt","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"data","sampleDate":{"sec":1377669600,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Dixie Valley Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":1028,"depth":6000,"coordinates":[39.935,-117.9],"size":726217},{"name":"Magnetotelluric Survey Raw Data.zip","size":171743376,"desc":"Raw Data from the Megnetotelluric Survey.

First, the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second, to stimulate multiple zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection\/ production profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced seismicity. Stimulation started October 17, 2012 and continued for 7 weeks, with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Two TZIM treatments successfully shifted the depth of stimulation. Injectivity, DTS, and seismic analysis indicate that fracture permeability in well NWG 55-29 was enhanced by two orders of magnitude.\n\nThis submission includes all of the files and reports associated with the geophysical exploration, stimulation, and monitoring included in the scope of the project.","created":"12\/04\/2013","email":"tcladouhos@altarockenergy.com","fullName":"Trenton T.

The geothermal system at Alum is wholly concealed; its upper reaches discovered in the late 1970s during a regional thermal-gradient drilling campaign. The prospect boasts several shallow thermal-gradient (TG) boreholes with TG >75oC\/km (and as high as 440oC\/km) over 200-m intervals in the depth range 0-600 m. Possibly boiling water encountered at 239 m depth in one of these boreholes returned chemical- geothermometry values in the range 150-230oC. GeothermEx (2008) has estimated the electrical- generation capacity of the current Alum leasehold at 33 megawatts for 20 years; and the corresponding value for the broader thermal anomaly extending beyond the property at 73 megawatts for the same duration.","created":"11\/20\/2013","email":"cmiller@ram-power.com","fullName":"Clay

Spring- and shallow-borehole thermal-water geochemistry and geothermometry suggest that a Silver Peak geothermal reservoir is very likely to attain the temperature range 260- 300oF (~125-150oC), and may reach 300-340oF (~150-170oC) or higher (GeothermEx, Inc., 2006). Results of detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis, and conceptual modeling of the prospect (1) support the GeothermEx (op. cit.) assertion that the Silver Peak prospect has good potential for geothermal-power production; and (2) provide a theoretical geologic framework for further exploration and development of the resource.\n\nThe Silver Peak prospect is situated in the transtensional (regional shearing coupled with extension) Walker Lane structural belt, and squarely within the late Miocene to Pliocene (11 Ma to ~5 Ma) Silver Peak-Lone Mountain metamorphic core complex (SPCC), a feature that accommodated initial displacement transfer between major right-lateral strike- slip fault zones on opposite sides of the Walker Lane. The SPCC consists essentially of a ductiley-deformed lower plate, or core, of Proterozoic metamorphic tectonites and tectonized Mesozoic granitoids separated by a regionally extensive, low-angle detachment fault from an upper plate of severely stretched and fractured structural slices of brittle, Proterozoic to Miocene-age lithologies. From a geothermal perspective, the detachment fault itself and some of the upper-plate structural sheets could function as important, if secondary, subhorizontal thermal-fluid aquifers in a Silver Peak hydrothermal system.","created":"11\/20\/2013","email":"cmiller@ram-power.com","fullName":"Clay Miller","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","Silver

The data was collected over a frequency range of 320Hz to 0.001Hz with variable site spacing. A number of different inversion algorithms in 1D, 2D and 3D were used to produce resistivity-depth profiles and maps of subsurface resistivity variations over the survey area. For 2D inversions, a total of eighteen lines were constructed in east-west and north-south orientations crossing the entire survey area. For MT 3D inversion, the New River property was divided in two sub-grids, Mesquite and New River areas.\n\nThe report comprises of two parts. For the first part, inversions and geophysical interpretation results are presented with some recommendations of the potential targets for future follow up on the property. The second part of the report describes logistics of the survey, survey parameters, methodology and the survey results (data) in digital documents.\n\nThe report reviews a Spartan MT survey carried out by Quantec Geoscience Limited over the New River Project in California, USA on behalf of Ram Power Inc.

These samples are then sent off for analysis in a fixed laboratory setting. Unfortunately by pulling the sample from the surface, information regarding the depth of the fractures generating the tracer flow is lost. Additionally, significant time is lost in sending the samples off for traditional chemical analysis.

Microseismic mapping is a key tool used to infer the subsurface fracture geometry. Traditional earthquake detection and location techniques are often employed to identify microearthquakes in geothermal regions. However, most commonly used algorithms may miss events if the seismic signal of an earthquake is small relative to the background noise level or if a microearthquake occurs within the coda of a larger event. Consequently, we have developed a set of algorithms that provide improved microearthquake detection. Our objective is to investigate the microseismicity at the DOE Newberry EGS site to better image the active regions of the underground fracture network during and immediately after the EGS stimulation.  Detection of more microearthquakes during EGS stimulations will allow for better seismic delineation of the active regions of the underground fracture system. This improved knowledge of the reservoir network will improve our understanding of subsurface conditions, and allow improvement of the stimulation strategy that will optimize heat extraction and maximize economic return.","created":"10\/01\/2013","email":"templeton4@llnl.gov","fullName":"Dennise Templeton","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","EGS","seismicity","microseismicity","stimulation","fracture","reservoir","earthquakes","monitoring","microseismic","seismic","Newberry"],"phone":"9254222021","projectNumber":"FY13 AOP 25728","publicationDate":{"sec":1380607200,"usec":0},"publisher":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"Improved Microseismicity Detection During Newberry EGS Stimulations","updated":[{"sec":1380637973,"usec":0},{"sec":1380638236,"usec":0},{"sec":1380822363,"usec":0},{"sec":1380834646,"usec":0},{"sec":1381182148,"usec":0},{"sec":1401892399,"usec":0},{"sec":1407180200,"usec":0},{"sec":1495829692,"usec":0},{"sec":1495829794,"usec":0},{"sec":1495829833,"usec":0},{"sec":1573771790,"usec":0},{"sec":1573773397,"usec":0},{"sec":1573773403,"usec":0},{"sec":1573773547,"usec":0}],"userId":6489,"resources":[{"name":"Earthquake Catalog.txt","size":23585,"desc":"Earthquake catalog of events occurring between October - December 2012 within or near the Newberry EGS site.

The initial analysis of life cycle fresh water consumption of geothermal power-generating systems identified that operational water requirements consumed the vast majority of water across the life cycle. However, it relied upon limited operational water consumption data and did not account for belowground operational losses for enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs). A second report presented an initial assessment of fresh water demand for future growth in utility-scale geothermal power generation. The current analysis builds upon this work to improve life cycle fresh water consumption estimates and incorporates regional water availability into the resource assessment to improve the identification of areas where future growth in geothermal electricity generation may encounter water challenges.","created":"09\/23\/2013","email":"jschroeder@anl.gov","fullName":"Jenna N.

A preliminary screening of the geothermal power potential of sedimentary basins in the U.S. assuming present day drilling costs, a levelized cost of electricity over 30 years of $10\/Wh, and realistic reservoir permeabilities, indicates that basins with heat flows of more than about 80 mW\/m2, reservoir temperatures of more than 175 degrees C, and a reservoir depth of less than 4 km are required. This puts the focus for future geothermal power generation on high heat flow regions of California (e.g. the Imperial Valley and regions adjacent to The Geysers), the Rio Grande rift system of New Mexico and Colorado (especially the Denver Basin), the Great Basin of the western U.S., and high heat flow parts of Hawaii and the Alaska volcanic arc. \n\nThis submission includes a Stage Gate Report on \"Novel Geothermal Development of Deep Sedimentary Systems in the United States\" in addition to the following resources compiled into a single PDF:\nFluid-Mineral and Reactional Path Calculations (Simmons, S.F. 2012)\nSummary of Coupled Fluid Geochemistry with Depth Analyses in the Great Basin and Adjoining Regions (Kirby, S.M. 2012)\nSummary of Compiled Permeability with Depth Measurements for Basin Fill, Igneous, Carbonate, and Siliciclastic Rocks in the Great Basin and Adjoining Regions (Kirby, S.M. 2012)\nReview of Permeability Characteristics in Drilled, Sediment-Hosted, Geothermal Systems (Anderson, T.C. 2012)\nStructural Geology of the Eastern Basin and Range; Structural Cross Sections Across Western Utah and Northeastern Nevada (Schelling, D.D. 2012)\nStratigraphic Reservoirs in the Great Basin-The Bridge to Development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems in the U.S. (Allis et al. 2012)\nPresentation: Stratigraphic Reservoirs in the Great Basin-the Bridge to Development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems in the U.S. (Allis et al. 2012)\nPresentation: Novel Geothermal Development of Deep Sedimentary Systems in the United States (Moore, J. and R.

GEO2D is a computer code for simulating ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems in two-dimensions. GEO2D performs a detailed finite difference simulation of the heat transfer occurring within the working fluid, the tube wall, the grout, and the ground. Both horizontal and vertical wells can be simulated with this program, but it should be noted that the vertical wall is modeled as a single tube.  This program also models the heat pump in conjunction with the heat transfer occurring. GEO2D simulates the heat pump and ground loop as a system. Many results are produced by GEO2D as a function of time and position, such as heat transfer rates, temperatures and heat pump performance. On top of this information from an economic comparison between the geothermal system simulated and a comparable air heat pump systems or a comparable gas, oil or propane heating systems with a vapor compression air conditioner. The version of GEO2D in the attached file has been coupled to the DOE heating and cooling load software called ENERGYPLUS. This is a great convenience for the user because heating and cooling loads are an input to GEO2D. GEO2D is a user friendly program that uses a graphical user interface for inputs and outputs. These make entering data simple and they produce many plotted results that are easy to understand.  In order to run GEO2D access to MATLAB is required. If this program is not available on your computer you can download the program MCRInstaller.exe, the 64 bit version, from the MATLAB website or from the Geothermal Data Repository.

In hydraulic fracturing, high fluid pressures are applied to confined zones in the subsurface usually using packers to fracture the host rock.  This enhances rock permeability and therefore conductive heat transfer to the circulating geothermal fluid (e.g. water or supercritical carbon dioxide).  The ultimate goal is to increase or improve the thermal energy production from the subsurface by either optimal designs of injection and production wells or by altering the fracture permeability to create different zones of circulation that can be exploited in geothermal heat extraction.  Moreover, hydraulic fracturing can lead to the creation of undesirable short-circuits or fast flow-paths between the injection and extraction wells leading to a short thermal residence time, low heat recovery, and thus a short-life of the EGS. \n\nA potential remedy to these problems is to deploy a cementing (blocking, diverting) agent to minimize short-cuts and\/or create new circulation cells for heat extraction.  A potential diverting agent is the colloidal silica by-product that can be co-produced from geothermal fluids.  Silica gels are abundant in various surface and subsurface applications, yet they have not been evaluated for EGS applications.  In this study we are investigating the benefits of silica gel deployment on thermal response of an EGS, either by blocking short-circuiting undesirable pathways as a result of diverting the geofluid to other fractures; or creating, within fractures, new circulation cells for harvesting heat through newly active surface area contact.  A significant advantage of colloidal silica is that it can be co-produced from geothermal fluids using an inexpensive membrane-based separation technology that was developed previously using DOE-GTP funding. \n\nThis co-produced silica has properties that potentially make it useful as a fluid diversion agent for subsurface applications.  Colloidal silica solutions exist as low-viscosity fluids during their \"induction period\" but then undergo a rapid increase in viscosity (gelation) to form a solid gel.  The length of the induction period can be manipulated by varying the properties of the solution, such as silica concentration and colloid size.  We believe it is possible to produce colloidal silica gels suitable for use as diverting agents for blocking undesirable fast-paths which result in short-circuiting the EGS once hydraulic fracturing has been deployed.   In addition, the gels could be used in conventional geothermal fields to increase overall energy recovery by modifying flow.","created":"06\/25\/2013","email":"hunt50@llnl.gov","fullName":"Jonathan Hunt","hasConsent":"1","keywords":["geothermal","zonal isolation","reservoir management","fluid diversion","colloidal silica","silica","coproduction"],"phone":"925.422.4266","projectNumber":"LLNL FY11 AOP 1","publicationDate":{"sec":1359615600,"usec":0},"publisher":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","status":"Publicly accessible","submissionName":"Applications of Geothermally-Produced Colloidal Silica in Reservoir Management - Smart Gels","updated":[{"sec":1372195479,"usec":0},{"sec":1373404413,"usec":0},{"sec":1407185943,"usec":0},{"sec":1495667206,"usec":0},{"sec":1495667306,"usec":0},{"sec":1495667383,"usec":0}],"userId":5825,"resources":[{"name":"GDR Report - Smart Gels.pdf","size":3507803,"desc":"Final Project Report titled \"Applications of Geothermally Produced Colloidal Silica in Reservoir Management - Smart Gels\"","tier":1,"actualName":"GDR Report - Smart Gels (1).pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1359615600,"usec":0},"coordinates":[40.0006779363,-118.4696109375],"extent":{"boundingCoordinatesNE":[44.773455872601,-112.8941],"boundingCoordinatesSW":[35.2279,-124.045121875]}},{"name":"Gel Calculator.xlsm","size":227789,"desc":"Excel-based calculator to calculate gelation times of colloidal silica solutions.

Results incorporate Argonne National Laboratory's Life Cycle Assessment and base case assumptions consistent with other projects in the Analysis subprogram.\nEROI is a ratio of the energy delivered to the consumer to the energy consumed to build, operate, and decommission the facility.  EROI is important in assessing the viability of energy alternatives.  Currently EROI analyses of geothermal energy are either out-of-date, of uncertain methodology, or presented online with little supporting documentation.\n\nThis data set is a collection of files documenting data used to calculate the Energy Return On Investment (EROI) of Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) and erratum to publications prior to the final report.  Final report is available below, or from the OSTI web site (http:\/\/www.osti.gov\/geothermal\/).

Exploiting these resources necessitates novel methods for drilling, stimulation, and maintenance, under operating conditions that are often difficult or impossible to reproduce in laboratory settings. Physically rigorous numerical modeling tools are vital to highlight potential risks, guide process optimization and reduce the uncertainties involved in developing new technologies for these environments. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has developed, and is constantly improving, several multi-physics solid\/structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, chemistry, and discrete element codes. Integration of the LLNL simulation tools into a coherent simulation environment will provide a predictive capability for the thermomechanical response - in particular the spall and fracture - of basement rocks at high temperatures and pressures useful for drilling and other geothermal applications. This paper outlines a modeling effort investigating the processes involved in hydrothermal spallation drilling. These include interconnected phenomena on several length and time scales: from system-scale fluid dynamics and heat transfer of the high temperature jet to the rock face to the grain-scale thermomechanics of spallation. Three models are described to capture these different scale processes: a grain-scale model to investigate the onset of spallation; a particulate fluids model to simulate the transport of the produced spalls; and a borehole-scale model to represent the integrated system behavior.","fullName":"Stuart D.C.

Complex natural fracture systems usually exist in the formations to be stimulated and it is therefore critical to understand the interactions between existing fractures and newly created fractures before optimal stimulation strategies can be developed.  Our study aims to improve the understanding of EGS stimulation-response relationships by developing and applying computer-based models that can effectively reflect the key mechanisms governing interactions between complex existing fracture networks and newly created hydraulic fractures.  In this paper, we first briefly describe the key modules of our methodology, namely a geomechanics solver, a discrete fracture flow solver, a rock joint response model, an adaptive remeshing module, and most importantly their effective coupling.  After verifying the numerical model against classical closed-form solutions, we investigate responses of reservoirs with different preexisting natural fractures to a variety of stimulation strategies.  The factors investigated include: the in situ stress states (orientation of the principal stresses and the degree of stress anisotropy), pumping pressure, and stimulation sequences of multiple wells.\n","fullName":"Pengcheng Fu","email":"fu4@llnl.gov","publisher":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1293865200,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","enhanced geothermal system","egs","discrete fracture flow","modeling","reservoir stimulation","stimulation","hydraulic fracturing"],"userId":4955,"created":"02\/07\/2013","updated":[{"sec":0,"usec":0},{"sec":1366450427,"usec":0},{"sec":1495574162,"usec":0},{"sec":1495574243,"usec":0},{"sec":1495574295,"usec":0},{"sec":1495574326,"usec":0},{"sec":1495574494,"usec":0},{"sec":1495575119,"usec":0},{"sec":1495575394,"usec":0}],"status":"Publicly accessible","resources":[{"name":"GRC Paper.pdf","size":1761487,"desc":"A paper published at the 2011 Geothermal Resources Council meeting detailing the investigation.","tier":1,"actualName":"GRC_2011_HydroFrac_Rev_withIllustration.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"other","sampleDate":{"sec":1314165600,"usec":0}},{"name":"GRC Presentation.pdf","size":5935068,"desc":"Presentation slides associated with the paper as presented at the 2011 GRC meeting","tier":1,"actualName":"EGS2-340pm-Fu.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"other","sampleDate":{"sec":1314165600,"usec":0}}],"projectLead":"Eric Hass","xdrId":170,"submitted":{"sec":1360276582,"usec":0},"projectTitle":"Stimulation of Complex Fracture Systems in Low Pressure Reservoirs for Development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems","hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Fu","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Scott M.","lastName":"Johnson","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Charles R.","lastName":"Carrigan","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"}],"DOI":"10.15121\/1358113","hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":true,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"517260fb627688fd45000027"},"submissionName":"Using Fully Coupled Hydro-Geomechanical Numerical Test Bed to Study Reservoir Stimulation with Low Hydraulic Pressure","projectNumber":"AID 19979","abstract":"This paper documents our effort to use a fully coupled hydro-geomechanical numerical test bed to study using low hydraulic pressure to stimulate geothermal reservoirs with existing fracture network. In this low pressure stimulation strategy, fluid pressure is lower than the minimum in situ compressive stress, so the fractures are not completely open but permeability improvement can be achieved through shear dilation. We found that in this low pressure regime, the coupling between the fluid phase and the rock solid phase becomes very simple, and the numerical model can achieve a low computational cost. Using this modified model, we study the behavior of a single fracture and a random fracture network.\n","fullName":"Pengcheng Fu","email":"fu4@llnl.gov","publisher":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","publicationDate":{"sec":1327993200,"usec":0},"keywords":["geothermal","reservoir modeling","hydraulic shearing","hydraulic fracturing","fracture","reservoir stimulation","low pressure","stimulation"],"userId":4955,"created":"02\/07\/2013","updated":[{"sec":0,"usec":0},{"sec":1366450427,"usec":0},{"sec":1495573657,"usec":0},{"sec":1495573672,"usec":0},{"sec":1495574275,"usec":0},{"sec":1495574413,"usec":0},{"sec":1495575387,"usec":0}],"status":"Publicly accessible","resources":[{"name":"SGW Paper.pdf","size":468334,"desc":"Paper published at the 2012 Stanford Geothermal Workshop detailing the methodology.","tier":1,"actualName":"SGW12_Fu_V1.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"other","sampleDate":{"sec":1327993200,"usec":0}},{"name":"SGW Presentation.pdf","size":6481895,"desc":"Presentation slides associated with the paper as presented at the 2012 Stanford Geothermal Workshop","tier":1,"actualName":"SGW12_Fu.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"other","sampleDate":{"sec":1327993200,"usec":0}}],"projectLead":"Eric Hass","xdrId":169,"submitted":{"sec":1360276133,"usec":0},"hasConsent":"1","authors":[{"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Fu","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Scott M.","lastName":"Johnson","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"firstName":"Charles R.","lastName":"Carrigan","affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"}],"projectTitle":"Stimulation of Complex Fracture Systems in Low Pressure Reservoirs for Development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems","DOI":"10.15121\/1358112","hasBeenCurated":true,"hasDOIAppropriateResources":true,"loggedInUser":[],"published":"12\/31\/1969"},{"_id":{"$id":"517260fb627688fd45000026"},"abstract":"Low permeability geothermal reservoirs can be stimulated by hydraulic fracturing to create Enhanced (or Engineered) Geothermal Systems (EGS) with higher permeability and improved heat transfer to increase heat production.

diamond compact (PDC) bits are routinely used in the oil and gas industry for drilling medium to hard rock but have not been adopted for geothermal drilling, largely due to past reliability issues and higher purchase costs.  The Sandia Geothermal Research Department has recently completed a field demonstration of the applicability of advanced synthetic diamond drill bits for production geothermal drilling.  Two commercially-available PDC bits were tested in a geothermal drilling program in the Chocolate Mountains in Southern California.  These bits drilled the granitic formations with significantly better Rate of Penetration (ROP) and bit life than the roller cone bit they are compared with. Drilling records and bit performance data along with associated drilling cost savings are presented herein.  The drilling trials have demonstrated PDC bit drilling technology has matured for applicability and improvements to geothermal drilling.  This will be especially beneficial for development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems whereby resources can be accessed anywhere within the continental US by drilling to deep, hot resources in hard, basement rock formations.\n\n","created":"12\/13\/2012","email":"sdknuds@sandia.gov","fullName":"Steven Knudsen","keywords":["geothermal","chocolate mountains","drilling","pdc bit","roller cone","granite","chocolate mountains drilling","synthetic diamond","rate of penetration","egs","lateral vibration spectrum","California","CA","Southern California","SoCal","drilling records","performance data","drilling charts","before and after","pictures","vibration spectrum"],"moratorium":{"releaseDate":{"sec":1495087200,"usec":0}},"projectNumber":"AID 20008","publicationDate":{"sec":1325401200,"usec":0},"publisher":"Sandia National Laboratories","resources":[{"name":"Final Report.pdf","size":1741669,"desc":"PDC Bits Outperform Conventional Bit in Geothermal Drilling Project, GRC Paper, Geothermal Resources Council 2012","tier":1,"actualName":"Sandia et al_GRC2012_FINAL.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"image_document","sampleDate":{"sec":1325401200,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Chocolate Mountains Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":81,"coordinates":[33.395202777778,-115.64776388889]},{"name":"PDC Bits vs.Conventional Bit in Geothermal Drilling.pdf","size":8888175,"desc":"GRC Presentation: PDC Bits Outperform Conventional Bit in Geothermal Drilling Project, Geothermal Resources Council 2012","tier":1,"actualName":"PDC Bits Outperform Conventional Bit in Geothermal Drilling.pdf","resourceType":"file","isLocal":true,"type":"presentation","sampleDate":{"sec":1325401200,"usec":0},"geothermalArea":"Chocolate Mountains Geothermal Area","surfaceElevation":81,"coordinates":[33.395202777778,-115.64776388889]},{"name":"Chocolate Mountain Drilling bit1.pdf","size":14026300,"desc":"This poster sized image contains before and after pictures of two bits, high rate lateral vibration spectrums, and various instrumentation plots during drilling.
